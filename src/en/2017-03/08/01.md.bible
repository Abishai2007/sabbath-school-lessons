            'Heb 2:14–18; 4:14, 15': '<h3> <span>Hebrews 2:14-18</span></h3><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, in all things He had to be made like <i>His</i> brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things <i>pertaining</i> to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted.</span></p><h3> <span>Hebrews 4:14</span></h3><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i>our</i> confession. </span> </p><h3> <span>Hebrews 4:15</span></h3><p> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all <i>points</i> tempted as <i>we are, yet</i> without sin. </span> </p>'
            'Gal 3:26–4:20': '<h3> <span>Galatians 3:26-4:20</span></h3><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>And if you <i>are</i> Christ&#x2019;s, then you are Abraham&#x2019;s seed, and heirs according to the promise.</span></p><p><span><span>4&#xA0;</span>Now I say <i>that</i> the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all, </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, &#x201C;Abba, Father!&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>But now after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how <i>is it that</i> you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage? </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>You observe days and months and seasons and years. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I <i>became</i> like you. You have not injured me at all. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, <i>even</i> as Christ Jesus. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>What then was the blessing you <i>enjoyed?</i> For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>They zealously court you, <i>but</i> for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you, </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.</span></p>'
            'Galatians 4:7': '<h3> <span>Galatians 4:7</span></h3><p> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</span></p>'
            'Rom 6:1–11': '<h3> <span>Romans 6:1-11</span></h3><p><span><span>6&#xA0;</span>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it? </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be <i>in the likeness</i> of <i>His</i> resurrection, </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>knowing this, that our old man was crucified with <i>Him,</i> that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>For he who has died has been freed from sin. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For <i>the death</i> that He died, He died to sin once for all; but <i>the life</i> that He lives, He lives to God. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></p>'
            'Rom 9:4, 5': '<h3> <span>Romans 9:4</span></h3><p> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>who are Israelites, to whom <i>pertain</i> the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service <i>of God,</i> and the promises; </span> </p><h3> <span>Romans 9:5</span></h3><p> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>of whom <i>are</i> the fathers and from whom, according to the flesh, Christ <i>came,</i> who is over all, <i>the</i> eternally blessed God. Amen.</span></p>'

> “So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God” (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:7">Galatians 4:7</a>, ESV).

Paul tells the Galatians that they should not live and act as slaves but as the sons and daughters of God, with all the rights and privileges thereof—a truth that the young Martin Luther needed to hear. As his convictions of sin deepened, the young man sought by his own works to obtain pardon and peace. He led a most rigorous life, endeavoring by fasting, vigils, and scourgings to subdue the evils of his nature, from which the monastic life had brought no relief. Luther shrank from no sacrifice by which he might attain such purity of heart that would enable him to stand approved before God. He was, he said later, a pious monk who strictly followed the rules of his order, and yet, he found no peace within them: “If ever monk could obtain heaven by his monkish works, I should certainly have been entitled to it.” Yet, it didn’t work for Luther.

Only as he later began to understand the truth about salvation in Christ, as revealed in Galatians, did he ever start to have any kind of spiritual freedom and hope for his own soul. As a result, too, our world has never been the same.
