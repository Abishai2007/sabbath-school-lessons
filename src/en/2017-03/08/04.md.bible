            'Heb 2:14–18; 4:14, 15': '<h3> <span>Hebrews 2:14-18</span></h3><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, in all things He had to be made like <i>His</i> brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things <i>pertaining</i> to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted.</span></p><h3> <span>Hebrews 4:14</span></h3><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i>our</i> confession. </span> </p><h3> <span>Hebrews 4:15</span></h3><p> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all <i>points</i> tempted as <i>we are, yet</i> without sin. </span> </p>'
            'Galatians 4:4, 5': '<h3> <span>Galatians 4:4</span></h3><p> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, </span> </p><h3> <span>Galatians 4:5</span></h3><p> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.</span></p>'
            'John 1:1–3, 18': '<h3> <span>John 1:1-3</span></h3><p><span><span>1&#xA0;</span>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>He was in the beginning with God. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. </span> </p><h3> <span>John 1:18</span></h3><p> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared <i>Him.</i></span></p>'
            'Rom 5:12–21': '<h3> <span>Romans 5:12-21</span></h3><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>(For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>But the free gift <i>is</i> not like the offense. For if by the one man&#x2019;s offense many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And the gift <i>is</i> not like <i>that which came</i> through the one who sinned. For the judgment <i>which came</i> from one <i>offense resulted</i> in condemnation, but the free gift <i>which came</i> from many offenses <i>resulted</i> in justification. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>For if by the one man&#x2019;s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.)</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, as through one man&#x2019;s offense <i>judgment came</i> to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man&#x2019;s righteous act <i>the free gift came</i> to all men, resulting in justification of life. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For as by one man&#x2019;s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man&#x2019;s obedience many will be made righteous.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Moreover the law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p>'
            'Dan 9:24–27': '<h3> <span>Daniel 9:24-27</span></h3><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Seventy weeks are determined</span><br><span>For your people and for your holy city,</span><br><span>To finish the transgression,</span><br><span>To make an end of sins,</span><br><span>To make reconciliation for iniquity,</span><br><span>To bring in everlasting righteousness,</span><br><span>To seal up vision and prophecy,</span><br><span>And to anoint the Most Holy.</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Know therefore and understand,</span><br><span><i>That</i> from the going forth of the command</span><br><span>To restore and build Jerusalem</span><br><span>Until Messiah the Prince,</span><br><span><i>There shall be</i> seven weeks and sixty-two weeks;</span><br><span>The street shall be built again, and the wall,</span><br><span>Even in troublesome times.</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;And after the sixty-two weeks</span><br><span>Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself;</span><br><span>And the people of the prince who is to come</span><br><span>Shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.</span><br><span>The end of it <i>shall be</i> with a flood,</span><br><span>And till the end of the war desolations are determined.</span><br><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Then he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week;</span><br><span>But in the middle of the week</span><br><span>He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering.</span><br><span>And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate,</span><br><span>Even until the consummation, which is determined,</span><br><span>Is poured out on the desolate.&#x201D;</span></p>'

_<a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:4">Gal. 4:4</a>_

**“But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law” (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:4">Gal. 4:4</a>, ESV).**

Paul’s choice of the word fullness indicates God’s active role in working out His purpose in human history. Jesus did not come at just any time; He came at the precise time God had prepared. From a historical perspective, that time is known as the Pax Romana (the Roman Peace), a two-hundred-year period of relative stability and peace across the Roman Empire. Rome’s conquest of the Mediterranean world brought peace, a common language, favorable means of travel, and a common culture that facilitated the rapid spread of the gospel. From a biblical perspective, it also marked the time that God had set for the coming of the promised Messiah (see <a class="verse" verse="Dan 9:24–27">Dan. 9:24–27</a>).

`Why did Christ have to take our humanity in order to redeem us? <a class="verse" verse="John 1:14">John 1:14</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:4, 5">Gal. 4:4, 5</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Rom 8:3, 4">Rom. 8:3, 4</a>; <a class="verse" verse="2 Cor 5:21">2 Cor. 5:21</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Phil 2:5–8">Phil. 2:5–8</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Heb 2:14–18; 4:14, 15">Heb. 2:14–18; 4:14, 15</a>.`

<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:4, 5">Galatians 4:4, 5</a> contains one of the most succinct accounts of the gospel in Scripture. These clear verses put forth God’s plan for the world, indicating that the coming of Jesus into human history was no accident. “God sent forth His Son.” In other words, God took the initiative in our salvation.

Also implicit in these words is the fundamental Christian belief in Christ’s eternal deity (<a class="verse" verse="John 1:1–3, 18">John 1:1–3, 18</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Phil 2:5–9">Phil. 2:5–9</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Col 1:15–17">Col. 1:15–17</a>). God did not send a heavenly messenger. He, Himself, came.

Although He was the divine preexistent Son of God, Jesus was also “born of woman.” Though the virgin birth is implied in this phrase, it more specifically affirms His genuine humanity.

The phrase “born under the law” points not only to Jesus’ Jewish heritage but also includes the fact that He bore our condemnation.

Thus, it was necessary for Christ to assume our humanity because we could not save ourselves. By uniting His divine nature with our fallen human nature, Christ legally became qualified to be our Substitute, Savior, and High Priest. As the second Adam, He came to reclaim all that the first Adam had lost by his disobedience (<a class="verse" verse="Rom 5:12–21">Rom. 5:12–21</a>). By His obedience, He perfectly fulfilled the law’s demands, thus redeeming Adam’s tragic failure. And by His death on the cross, He met the justice of the law, which required the death of the sinner, thus gaining the right to redeem all who come to Him in true faith and surrender.
