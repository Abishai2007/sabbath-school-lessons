            '2 Pet 3:15, 16': '<h3> <span>2 Peter 3:15</span></h3><p> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>and consider <i>that</i> the longsuffering of our Lord <i>is</i> salvation&#x2014;as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you, </span> </p><h3> <span>2 Peter 3:16</span></h3><p> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which untaught and unstable <i>people</i> twist to their own destruction, as <i>they do</i> also the rest of the Scriptures.</span></p>'
            'Galatians 1:10': '<h3> <span>Galatians 1:10</span></h3><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.</span></p>'
            'Galatians 1': '<h3> <span>Galatians 1</span></h3><p><span><span>1&#xA0;</span>Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead), </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>and all the brethren who are with me,</span></p><p><span>To the churches of Galatia:</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>to whom <i>be</i> glory forever and ever. Amen.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught <i>it,</i> but <i>it came</i> through the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and <i>tried to</i> destroy it. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother&#x2019;s womb and called <i>me</i> through His grace, </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood, </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those <i>who were</i> apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and remained with him fifteen days. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord&#x2019;s brother. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>(Now <i>concerning</i> the things which I write to you, indeed, before God, I do not lie.)</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Afterward I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which <i>were</i> in Christ. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But they were hearing only, &#x201C;He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which he once <i>tried to</i> destroy.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And they glorified God in me.</span></p>'
            'Phil 1:1': '<h3> <span>Philippians 1:1</span></h3><p><span><span>1&#xA0;</span>Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ,</span></p><p><span>To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</span></p>'
            'Gal 5:12': '<h3> <span>Galatians 5:12</span></h3><p> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>I could wish that those who trouble you would even cut themselves off!</span></p>'

Students at a university built a center on their campus where everyone—regardless of race, gender, social status, or religious beliefs—would be welcome. Imagine if years later these students returned to the campus only to discover that other students had redesigned the center. Instead of the large room with plenty of space for socializing—designed to bring a sense of unity to everyone there—the room had been subdivided into many smaller rooms with entrance restrictions based on race, gender, and so forth. The students responsible for the redesign might have argued that their authority to make these changes came from centuries-old established practice.

This is something like the situation that Paul faced when he wrote his letter to the churches in Galatia. His plan that Gentiles could join on the basis of faith alone was being challenged by false teachers who insisted that Gentiles must also be circumcised before they could become members.

This position, Paul saw, was an attack on the essence of the gospel itself; thus, he had to respond. The response is the letter to the Galatians.
