**“Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage” (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 5:1">Gal. 5:1</a>).**

Like the rallying command of a military leader to his wavering troops, Paul charges the Galatians not to surrender their freedom in Christ. The forcefulness and intensity of Paul’s tone cause his words nearly to leap off the page into action. In fact, this seems to be exactly what Paul intends. Although this verse is connected thematically to what precedes and what follows, its abruptness and lack of syntactical connections in Greek suggest that Paul wants this verse to stand out like a gigantic billboard. Freedom in Christ sums up Paul’s entire argument, and the Galatians are in danger of giving it away.

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 1:3, 4; 2:16">Galatians 1:3, 4; 2:16</a>; and 3:13. What are some of the metaphors used in these verses, and how do they help us understand what Christ has done for us?`

Paul’s words, “for freedom Christ has set us free” (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 5:1">Gal. 5:1</a>, ESV), may suggest that he has another metaphor in mind here. The wording of this phrase is similar to the formula used in the sacred freeing (manumission) of slaves. Because slaves had no legal rights, it was supposed that a deity could purchase their freedom, and in return, the slaves, though really free, would legally belong to the god. Of course, in actual practice the process was fiction; it was the slave who paid the money into the temple treasury for his or her freedom. Consider, for example, the formula used in one of the nearly one thousand inscriptions that date from 201 b.c. to a.d. 100 at the temple to Pythian Apollo at Delphi: “‘For Freedom, Apollo the Pythian bought from Sosibus of Amphissa a female slave whose name is Nicaea. . . . The purchase, however, Nicaea has committed unto Apollo for freedom.’”—Ben Witherington III, Grace in Galatia (Grand Rapids, Mich.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1998), p. 340.

This formula shares a basic similarity with Paul’s terminology, but there is a fundamental difference. In Paul’s metaphor, no fiction is involved. We did not provide the purchase price ourselves (<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 6:20, 7:23">1 Cor. 6:20, 7:23</a>). The price was far too high for us. Although we were powerless to save ourselves, Jesus stepped in and did for us what we could not do (at least not without forfeiting our lives). He paid the penalty for our sins, thus freeing us from condemnation.

`Look at your own life. Do you ever think that you could save yourself? What should your answer tell you about how grateful you need to be for what we have been given in Jesus?`
