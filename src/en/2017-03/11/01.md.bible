            'Rom 8:4; 13:8': '<h3> <span>Romans 8:4</span></h3><p> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. </span> </p><h3> <span>Romans 13:8</span></h3><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law. </span> </p>'
            'Galatians 5:13': '<h3> <span>Galatians 5:13</span></h3><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not <i>use</i> liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. </span> </p>'
            'Heb 2:14, 15': '<h3> <span>Hebrews 2:14</span></h3><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, </span> </p><h3> <span>Hebrews 2:15</span></h3><p> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. </span> </p>'
            'Galatians 2:4': '<h3> <span>Galatians 2:4</span></h3><p> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And <i>this occurred</i> because of false brethren secretly brought in (who came in by stealth to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage), </span> </p>'
            'Gal 5:1–15': '<h3> <span>Galatians 5:1-15</span></h3><p><span><span>5&#xA0;</span>Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>You have become estranged from Christ, you who <i>attempt to</i> be justified by law; you have fallen from grace. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>You ran well.

Then the offense of the cross has ceased. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>I could wish that those who trouble you would even cut themselves off!</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not <i>use</i> liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, <i>even</i> in this: <span>&#x201C;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another!</span></p>'

> “For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another” (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 5:13">Galatians 5:13</a>, ESV).

In <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 2:4">Galatians 2:4</a>, Paul briefly referred to the importance of protecting the “freedom” that we have in Christ Jesus. But what does Paul mean when he speaks about “freedom,” which he does so often? What does this freedom include? How far does this freedom go? Does it have any limits? And what connection does freedom in Christ have to the law?

Paul addresses these questions by warning the Galatians of two dangers. The first is legalism. Paul’s opponents in Galatia were so caught up trying to earn God’s favor through their behavior that they lost sight of the liberating nature of Christ’s work, in the salvation that they already had in Christ through faith. The second threat is the tendency to abuse the freedom Christ has purchased for us by lapsing into licentiousness. Those who hold this view mistakenly assume that freedom is antithetical to the law.

In actuality, both legalism and licentiousness are opposed to freedom, because they equally keep their adherents in a form of slavery. Paul’s appeal to the Galatians, however, is to stand firm in the true freedom that is their rightful possession in Christ.
