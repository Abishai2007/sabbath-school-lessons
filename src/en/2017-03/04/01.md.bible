            'Galatians 2:20': '<h3> <span>Galatians 2:20</span></h3><p> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the <i>life</i> which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. </span> </p>'
            'Gal 2:15–21': '<h3> <span>Galatians 2:15-21</span></h3><p> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>We <i>who are</i> Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, <i>is</i> Christ therefore a minister of sin? Certainly not! </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the <i>life</i> which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness <i>comes</i> through the law, then Christ died in vain.&#x201D;</span></p>'
            'Rom 3:10–20': '<h3> <span>Romans 3:10-20</span></h3><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>As it is written:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x201C;There is none righteous, no, not one;</span></span><br><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup><span>There is none who understands;</span></span><br><span><span>There is none who seeks after God.</span></span><br><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup><span>They have all turned aside;</span></span><br><span><span>They have together become unprofitable;</span></span><br><span><span>There is none who does good, no, not one.&#x201D;</span></span><br><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;<span>Their throat <i>is</i> an open tomb;</span></span><br><span><span>With their tongues they have practiced deceit&#x201D;</span>; </span><br><span><span>&#x201C;The poison of asps</span> <i>is</i> <span>under their lips&#x201D;</span>; </span><br><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;Whose mouth <i>is</i> full of cursing and bitterness.&#x201D;</span></span><br><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;Their feet <i>are</i> swift to shed blood;</span></span><br><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup><span>Destruction and misery</span> <i>are</i> <span>in their ways;</span></span><br><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup><span>And the way of peace they have not known.&#x201D;</span></span><br><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;There is no fear of God before their eyes.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law <i>is</i> the knowledge of sin.</span></p>'
            'Gen 15:5, 6': '<h3> <span>Genesis 15:5</span></h3><p> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Then He brought him outside and said, &#x201C;Look now toward heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them.&#x201D; And He said to him, &#x201C;So shall your descendants be.&#x201D;</span></p><h3> <span>Genesis 15:6</span></h3><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And he believed in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and He accounted it to him for righteousness.</span></p>'

> “I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me” (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</a>, ESV).

As we saw last week, Paul publicly confronted Peter in Antioch for the lack of consistency between the faith he advocated and the behavior he displayed. Peter’s decision not to eat with former pagans suggested that they were second-rate Christians at best. His actions implied that if they really wanted to be part of the family of God and enjoy the blessings of full table fellowship, they must first submit to the rite of circumcision.

What did Paul actually say to Peter on that tense occasion? In this week’s lesson, we will study what is likely a summary of what went on. This passage contains some of the most compressed wording in the New Testament, and it is extremely significant, because it introduces us for the first time to several words and phrases that are foundational both to understanding the gospel and the rest of Paul’s letter to the Galatians. These key words include justification, righteousness, works of law, belief, and not only faith but the faith of Jesus.

What does Paul mean by these terms, and what do they teach us about the plan of salvation?
