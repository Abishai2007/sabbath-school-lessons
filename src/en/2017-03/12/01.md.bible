            'Galatians 5:16': '<h3> <span>Galatians 5:16</span></h3><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. </span> </p>'

So you shall put away the evil from your midst.</span></p>'
            'Gal 5:16–25': '<h3> <span>Galatians 5:16-25</span></h3><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told <i>you</i> in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And those <i>who are</i> Christ&#x2019;s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. </span> </p>'
            'Rom 7:14–24': '<h3> <span>Romans 7:14-24</span></h3><p> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For what I am doing, I do not understand. For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate, that I do. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>If, then, I do what I will not to do, I agree with the law that <i>it is</i> good. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>But now, <i>it is</i> no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but <i>how</i> to perform what is good I do not find. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For the good that I will <i>to do,</i> I do not do; but the evil I will not <i>to do,</i> that I practice. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Now if I do what I will not <i>to do,</i> it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? </span> </p>'

> “But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh” (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 5:16">Galatians 5:16</a>, ESV).

One of the most beloved Christian hymns is Robert Robinson’s “Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing.” Robinson, however, was not always a man of faith. The death of his father left him angry, and he fell into debauchery and drunkenness. After hearing the famous preacher George Whitefield, Robinson surrendered his life to the Lord, became a Methodist pastor, and wrote that hymn, which originally included the lines: “Oh, to grace how great a debtor / Daily I’m constrained to be! / Let Thy goodness, like a fetter, / Bind my wandering heart to Thee.”

Uncomfortable with the line about the Christian’s heart wandering, someone changed the words to read: “Prone to worship, Lord, I feel it, Prone to love the God I serve.”

Despite the editor’s good intentions, the original words accurately describe the Christian struggle. As believers we possess two natures, the flesh and the Spirit, and they are in conflict. Although our sinful nature always will be “prone” to wander from God, if we are willing to surrender to His Spirit, we do not have to be enslaved to the desires of the flesh. This is the thrust of Paul’s message in the texts for the week.
