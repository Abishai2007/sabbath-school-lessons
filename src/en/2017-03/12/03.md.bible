            'Rom 7:14–24': '<h3> <span>Romans 7:14-24</span></h3><p> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For what I am doing, I do not understand. For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate, that I do. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>If, then, I do what I will not to do, I agree with the law that <i>it is</i> good. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>But now, <i>it is</i> no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but <i>how</i> to perform what is good I do not find. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For the good that I will <i>to do,</i> I do not do; but the evil I will not <i>to do,</i> that I practice. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Now if I do what I will not <i>to do,</i> it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? </span> </p>'
            'Gal 5:17': '<h3> <span>Galatians 5:17</span></h3><p> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. </span> </p>'
            'Rom 8:7': '<h3> <span>Romans 8:7</span></h3><p> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Because the carnal mind <i>is</i> enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be. </span> </p>'
            'John 3:6': '<h3> <span>John 3:6</span></h3><p> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup><span>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> </span> </p>'
            'Romans 7': '<h3> <span>Romans 7</span></h3><p><span><span>7&#xA0;</span>Or do you not know, brethren (for I speak to those who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives? </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>For the woman who has a husband is bound by the law to <i>her</i> husband as long as he lives. But if the husband dies, she is released from the law of <i>her</i> husband. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>So then if, while <i>her</i> husband lives, she marries another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she has married another man. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another&#x2014;to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should bear fruit to God. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit to death. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>But now we have been delivered from the law, having died to what we were held by, so that we should serve in the newness of the Spirit and not <i>in</i> the oldness of the letter.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>What shall we say then? <i>Is</i> the law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, <span>&#x201C;You shall not covet.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But sin, taking opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all <i>manner of evil</i> desire. For apart from the law sin <i>was</i> dead. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>I was alive once without the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>And the commandment, which <i>was</i> to <i>bring</i> life, I found to <i>bring</i> death. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed <i>me.</i> </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the law <i>is</i> holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Has then what is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For what I am doing, I do not understand. For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate, that I do. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>If, then, I do what I will not to do, I agree with the law that <i>it is</i> good. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>But now, <i>it is</i> no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but <i>how</i> to perform what is good I do not find. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For the good that I will <i>to do,</i> I do not do; but the evil I will not <i>to do,</i> that I practice. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Now if I do what I will not <i>to do,</i> it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>I thank God&#x2014;through Jesus Christ our Lord!</span></p><p><span>So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.</span></p>'

`“For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would” (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 5:17">Gal. 5:17</a>; see also <a class="verse" verse="Rom 7:14–24">Rom. 7:14–24</a>). How have you, in your own life as a believer, experienced the harsh and painful reality of these words?`

The struggle that Paul describes is not the struggle of every human being. It refers specifically to the inward tug-of-war that exists in the Christian. Because humans are born in harmony with the desires of the flesh (<a class="verse" verse="Rom 8:7">Rom. 8:7</a>), it is only when we are born anew by the Spirit that a real spiritual conflict begins to emerge (<a class="verse" verse="John 3:6">John 3:6</a>). This does not mean that non-Christians never experience moral conflict; they certainly do. But even that conflict is ultimately a result of the Spirit. The struggle of the Christian, however, takes on a new dimension, because the believer possesses two natures that are at war with each other, the flesh and the Spirit.

Throughout history, Christians have longed for relief from this struggle. Some have sought to end the conflict by withdrawing from society, while others have claimed that the sinful nature can be eradicated by some divine act of grace. Both attempts are misguided. Though by the Spirit’s power we certainly can subdue the desires of the flesh, the conflict will continue in various ways until we receive a new body at the Second Coming. Fleeing from society does not help, because no matter where we go, we take the struggle with us, and we will until death or the Second Coming.

When Paul writes in <a class="verse" verse="Romans 7">Romans 7</a> about the inward conflict in Christians as preventing them from doing what they want, he is underscoring the full extent of that conflict. Because we possess two natures, we are literally on both sides of the battle at once. The spiritual part of us desires what is spiritual and detests the flesh. The fleshly part of us, however, longs for the things of the flesh and opposes what is spiritual. Because the converted mind is too weak to resist the flesh by itself, the only hope we have of subduing the flesh is by making a daily decision to side with the Spirit against our sinful selves. This is why Paul is so insistent that we choose to walk in the Spirit.

`From your own experience of the battle between these two natures, what advice would you give to a Christian who is trying to come to terms with this never-ending struggle with self?`
