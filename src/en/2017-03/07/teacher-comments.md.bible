            'Galatians 3:8–10, 15': '<h3> <span>Galatians 3:8-10</span></h3><p> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, <i>saying,</i> <span>&#x201C;In you all the nations shall be blessed.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>So then those who <i>are</i> of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, <span>&#x201C;Cursed</span> <i>is</i> <span>everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.&#x201D;</span> </span> </p><h3> <span>Galatians 3:15</span></h3><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though <i>it is</i> only a man&#x2019;s covenant, yet <i>if it is</i> confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it. </span> </p>'

Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. </span> </p>'

            'Gal 3:24, 25': '<h3> <span>Galatians 3:24</span></h3><p> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the law was our tutor <i>to bring us</i> to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. </span> </p><h3> <span>Galatians 3:25</span></h3><p> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</span></p>'

For apart from the law sin <i>was</i> dead. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>I was alive once without the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>And the commandment, which <i>was</i> to <i>bring</i> life, I found to <i>bring</i> death. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed <i>me.</i> </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the law <i>is</i> holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Has then what is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful. </span> </p>'
            'John 8:1–11': '<h3> <span>John 8:1-11</span></h3><p><span><span>8&#xA0;</span>But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Now early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him; and He sat down and taught them. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>they said to Him, &#x201C;Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>This they said, testing Him, that they might have <i>something</i> of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with <i>His</i> finger, as though He did not hear.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, <span>&#x201C;He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then those who heard <i>it,</i> being convicted by <i>their</i> conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest <i>even</i> to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, <span>&#x201C;Woman, where are those accusers of yours?</span><span> Has no one condemned you?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>She said, &#x201C;No one, Lord.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>And Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Neither do I condemn you; go and</span> <span>sin no more.&#x201D;</span></span></p>'
            'John 4:1–42': '<h3> <span>John 4:1-42</span></h3><p><span><span>4&#xA0;</span>Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>(though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples), </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>He left Judea and departed again to Galilee. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>But He needed to go through Samaria.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Now Jacob&#x2019;s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from <i>His</i> journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Give Me a drink.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, &#x201C;How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?&#x201D; For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Jesus answered and said to her, <span>&#x201C;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, &#x2018;Give Me a drink,&#x2019; you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>The woman said to Him, &#x201C;Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep.

But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>The woman said to Him, &#x201C;Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Go, call your husband, and come here.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>The woman answered and said, &#x201C;I have no husband.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;You have well said, &#x2018;I have no husband,&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup><span>for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; in that you spoke truly.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>The woman said to Him, &#x201C;Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you <i>Jews</i> say that in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father.</span> </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup><span>You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews.</span> </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup><span>But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.</span> </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup><span>God <i>is</i> Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>The woman said to Him, &#x201C;I know that Messiah is coming&#x201D; (who is called Christ). &#x201C;When He comes, He will tell us all things.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;I who speak to you am <i>He.</i>&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>And at this <i>point</i> His disciples came, and they marveled that He talked with a woman; yet no one said, &#x201C;What do You seek?&#x201D; or, &#x201C;Why are You talking with her?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>The woman then left her waterpot, went her way into the city, and said to the men, </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Come, see a Man who told me all things that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Then they went out of the city and came to Him.</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>In the meantime His disciples urged Him, saying, &#x201C;Rabbi, eat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>But He said to them, <span>&#x201C;I have food to eat of which you do not know.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the disciples said to one another, &#x201C;Has anyone brought Him <i>anything</i> to eat?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work.</span> </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup><span>Do you not say, &#x2018;There are still four months and <i>then</i> comes the harvest&#x2019;? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest!</span> </span> <span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup><span>And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</span> </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup><span>For in this the saying is true: &#x2018;One sows and another reaps.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup><span>I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labors.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, &#x201C;He told me all that I <i>ever</i> did.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>So when the Samaritans had come to Him, they urged Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days. </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>And many more believed because of His own word.</span></p><p><span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>Then they said to the woman, &#x201C;Now we believe, not because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard <i>Him</i> and we know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.&#x201D;</span></p>'

            'John 8:1–11': '<h3> <span>John 8:1-11</span></h3><p><span><span>8&#xA0;</span>Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</span></p>'
            'John 4:1–42': '<h3> <span>John 4:1-42</span></h3><p><span><span>4&#xA0;</span>When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And he must needs go through Samaria.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Now Jacob&apos;s well was there.

### The Lesson in Brief

**Key Text**: <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:22">Galatians 3:22</a>

#### The Student Will:

- **Know**: Explain how the law, while not giving life, protects and points us to Christ.
- **Feel**: Nurture a love for the law as it is reflected in the sacrificial system and the foundation of God’s kingdom.
- **Do**: Submit to the law’s discipline as it leads us to the One who writes His law on our hearts.

#### Learning Outline:

1. Know: Submitting to Discipline
+ In what ways is the law a blessing as it serves as guard and disciplinarian?
+ What relationship do believers in Christ have to the law?
+ How are the requirements of the law fulfilled in us?

2. Feel: Loving the Law
+ How do we come to love the law by reflecting on the depths to which the Father and Son went to ensure our salvation?
+ How does the sacrifice of Christ illustrate the great value that God places on His beautiful, holy, and eternal law?

3. Do: Written on Our Hearts
+ As we see the cost that Christ has paid to meet the law’s requirements on our behalf, how do we respond?
+ How do we cooperate as God writes His laws on our hearts?
+ What part does faith play in the fulfillment of the law in our hearts?

**Summary**: While the law acts as a guard and disciplinarian, it points us to Christ. By submitting to the Father’s will, Christ fulfilled the requirements of the law. By living His life, we allow God to write the law on our hearts.

#### Learning Cycle

##### STEP 1—Motivate

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Without the law of God, human beings would not know what sin is or what God expects of them. However, keeping the law requires more than mere knowledge; it necessitates power that comes only from the Lawgiver, dispensed through His Christ.

**Just for Teachers**: Share the following in your own words. Some of the students may remember this iconic commercial and its unforgettable tagline.

Many years ago an auto commercial captured the fancy of the national audience, no doubt because of the simple yet profound message it delivered. The commercial featured a woman driving a vehicle and thinking what it would be like to cross the lines on the highway and “go for broke.” She remembers her childhood days when she would “color outside the lines” of the figures in her coloring book.

The fantasy comes to an abrupt end when the voice of her kindergarten teacher jolts her back to reality. What did the teacher say? “Stay between the lines. The lines are our friends.”

**Consider This**: Ask the class why some people are fascinated by life outside the lines, while others obsess about staying within them. How can we keep God’s law without becoming legalists?

##### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: The Hebrews were selected by God to be His representatives on earth, leading others to Him by the example of faith and connection with God that they lived. However, that didn’t always work out as planned.

**Bible Commentary**

**I. Legal Righteousness** (Read <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:8–10, 15">Galatians 3:8–10, 15</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Mark 7:1–7">Mark 7:1–7</a>.)

The law given by God to Moses was very detailed. Specific blessings were attached to the keeping of it, such as this one: “Now it shall come to pass, if you diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God, to observe carefully all His commandments which I command you today, that the Lord your God will set you high above all nations of the earth. And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, because you obey the voice of the Lord your God” (<a class="verse" verse="Deut 28:1, 2">Deut. 28:1, 2</a>, NKJV). Who wouldn’t want a blessing like that?

But God didn’t stop at the enunciation of blessings that would attend obedience to His laws; He also listed a number of curses for disobedience, such as this one: “Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the country” (vs. 16, NKJV). Because any deviation from the law could bring on the curse of God, the Israelites took great pains to “keep the law.” By doing so, they met its legal stipulations. Lawkeepers possessed a “legal righteousness.”

Eventually, God’s people added more laws than even God had given. They did this in order to be sure that the laws God gave were kept, or at least that was their idea. The Israelites were on a mission to master God’s “dos and don’ts.”

**Consider This**: How did Jesus respond to the brand of tradition-cumreligion promulgated and practiced by some of the religious leaders of His day? (<a class="verse" verse="Mark 7:5–8">Mark 7:5–8</a>). Why was this brand of religion so odious to the Son of God? What was missing from it?

**II. Faith in Practice** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:19–23">Galatians 3:19–23</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 12:1–4">Genesis 12:1–4</a> with your class.)

Tuesday’s study examines Paul’s “seemingly” negative statements about the moral law and its civil and ceremonial counterparts. However, Paul states unequivocally that the law does not nullify the promise of God to Abraham and his seed. It actually brings that seed to the foot of the cross of Jesus, where true justification occurs (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 3:24, 25">Gal. 3:24, 25</a>).

It bears remembering here that Paul is haggling with the Jews in an effort to share the gospel with Gentile believers, who desperately need it. Paul’s effort is in line with God’s original purpose in calling out a people, Abraham and his heirs (<a class="verse" verse="Gen 12:1–4">Gen. 12:1–4</a>), through whom all nations of the earth were to be blessed. “The objective of God’s covenant with Abraham was the coming of the Messiah and the salvation of men.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 957.

God’s chosen people did not always follow Him in this venture. They copied the hedonistic practices of the world. In other words, the faith they practiced was one that bore little resemblance to the holiness of the God they claimed to serve.

**Consider This**: How does the practice of our faith impact those around us? What essential truths are we called to share with a dying world? Many in ancient Israel believed that the Abrahamic blessing was theirs and theirs alone. In what ways do we sometimes cherish our exclusivity to the detriment of those yearning for the good news of salvation?

**III. A Little History** (Read <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:19">Galatians 3:19</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Romans 7:7–13">Romans 7:7–13</a>.)

Humanity’s penchant for self-delusion is great. Hence, God does everything within His power to open our eyes to the sanctity of His laws, His ways, and His life. This was God’s objective in giving the moral law at Mount Sinai and the civil and ceremonial laws that followed.

Humans need the law because they need to know what is right and what is wrong. For instance, the Lord reiterated the law at Sinai because, after many long years in Egypt, the Hebrews lost sight of what God’s ways were.

“During the long, dark bondage in Egypt, where they dwelt amid the blackest paganism and the most depraved immorality, they well-nigh lost their understanding or awareness of God’s moral standards, and of even the most rudimentary ideas of sacrifices. And when men come to such a state, they are insensitive to sin, for it is by ‘the law’ that we have the knowledge of sin. As Paul declares elsewhere, ‘I had not known sin, but by the law’ (<a class="verse" verse="Rom 7:7">Rom. 7:7</a>).” —The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 959.

**Consider This**: God’s laws function in much the same way today. They help us to see in stark relief God’s view of sin and point us to the Christ, the One who has made atonement for that sin. Is there a point at which the sensitizing influence of God’s law ceases to jolt us back to reality? Explain.

##### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Encourage your students to internalize the questions below. The objective is for each person to take a hard look at himself or herself.

**Thought Questions**:

1. Contemplating the law of the Lord, King David wrote the following: “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple” (<a class="verse" verse="Ps 19:7">Ps. 19:7</a>, NKJV). What do you think the psalmist meant by the word perfect? What’s perfect about God’s law?
2. In <a class="verse" verse="Joshua 1:8">Joshua 1:8</a>, God counsels Joshua to keep the book of the law in his mouth and meditate on it day and night. Why was it important that the nation’s leader know, speak, and live the law? How does this admonition extend to followers of God today?

**Application Questions**:

1. <a class="verse" verse="Jeremiah 17:9">Jeremiah 17:9</a> states: “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?” (NKJV). How do God’s laws help to corral the human heart?
2. Which of God’s laws do you have the most trouble obeying? Why?

**Questions for Witnessing**:

1. When is it appropriate to share God’s requirements with people to whom we give the gospel? Many unchurched people are often surprised by what the Bible has to say on different subjects. How do we get by their initial surprise—and at times disdain—in order to share with them the blessing and joys of obedience to God’s dictates?
2. Think about the ministry of Jesus to the woman at the well (<a class="verse" verse="John 4:1–42">John 4:1–42</a>). What was it about Jesus that drew this woman to Him? In extending grace to the woman, did Jesus gloss over dictates of the law concerning marriage? Contrast this experience with the woman caught in adultery (<a class="verse" verse="John 8:1–11">John 8:1–11</a>). Why did Jesus embrace her with His forgiveness and love rather than condemn her for her adulterous behavior? How was Jesus able to find the right balance between applying the law and applying grace?

##### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: Share the following true story in your own words. The objective here is to see clearly the inability of the law to prevent human beings from behaving in unethical, and even criminal, ways. Emphasize our need for a deep abiding relationship with God!

We live in the age of identity theft. One woman recently came home to find a host of frantic messages left on her voicemail by a credit fraud division of a huge department store. What was the problem? Someone in another city was attempting to buy $1,500 worth of goods using her credit card. The would-be thief had even tried to change the cardholder’s address to her own city. Because the woman who owned the card had never lived in that city, nor had she been there in more than two years, the whole episode was quite a wake-up call.

There are international crime syndicates whose sole goal is to profit from identity theft. But how do we explain those people who try to get ahead by falsifying information about their lives? For example, a college student recently secured more than $45,000 worth of scholarship money under false pretenses, $14,000 of which came from a prestigious university. While applying for several scholarships, he falsified recommendations, claimed a perfect score on a college entrance exam, plagiarized the work of professors, listed books he had coauthored, courses he had taught, and lectures he had delivered. All of which were false.

What prompts people to commit crimes such as the ones mentioned above? Sure, there is obvious criminal pathology, but go beyond the obvious. How could a relationship with Jesus have played any significant role in changing the behavior of the identity fraudsters mentioned above? How do we quantify the difference that Jesus makes in a life?
