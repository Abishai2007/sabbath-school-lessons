        verses:
            'Rom 3:1, 2; 8:1–4': '<h3> <span>Romans 3:1</span></h3><p><span><span>3&#xA0;</span>What advantage then has the Jew, or what <i>is</i> the profit of circumcision? </span> </p><h3> <span>Romans 3:2</span></h3><p> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Much in every way! Chiefly because to them were committed the oracles of God. </span> </p><h3> <span>Romans 8:1-4</span></h3><p><span><span>8&#xA0;</span><i>There is</i> therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God <i>did</i> by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. </span> </p>'
            'Galatians 3:22': '<h3> <span>Galatians 3:22</span></h3><p> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. </span> </p>'
            'Gal 3:21–25': '<h3> <span>Galatians 3:21-25</span></h3><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup><i>Is</i> the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the law was our tutor <i>to bring us</i> to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</span></p>'
            'Rom 3:9–19': '<h3> <span>Romans 3:9-19</span></h3><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>What then? Are we better <i>than they?</i> Not at all. For we have previously charged both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>As it is written:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x201C;There is none righteous, no, not one;</span></span><br><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup><span>There is none who understands;</span></span><br><span><span>There is none who seeks after God.</span></span><br><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup><span>They have all turned aside;</span></span><br><span><span>They have together become unprofitable;</span></span><br><span><span>There is none who does good, no, not one.&#x201D;</span></span><br><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;<span>Their throat <i>is</i> an open tomb;</span></span><br><span><span>With their tongues they have practiced deceit&#x201D;</span>; </span><br><span><span>&#x201C;The poison of asps</span> <i>is</i> <span>under their lips&#x201D;</span>; </span><br><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;Whose mouth <i>is</i> full of cursing and bitterness.&#x201D;</span></span><br><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;Their feet <i>are</i> swift to shed blood;</span></span><br><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup><span>Destruction and misery</span> <i>are</i> <span>in their ways;</span></span><br><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup><span>And the way of peace they have not known.&#x201D;</span></span><br><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;There is no fear of God before their eyes.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. </span> </p>'
            '1 Cor 9:20': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 9:20</span></h3><p> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those <i>who are</i> under the law, as under the law, that I might win those <i>who are</i> under the law; </span> </p>'
            'Lev 18:5': '<h3> <span>Leviticus 18:5</span></h3><p> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>You shall therefore keep My statutes and My judgments, which if a man does, he shall live by them: I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p>'

Homing pigeons long have been known for their ability to fly hundreds of miles a day and arrive at their destination with amazing accuracy. Yet, even the best homing pigeons at times have become disoriented, never returning to their starting point. The worst incident happened in England, when tens of thousands of birds never came back to their lofts.

As most of us have experienced in one way or another, being disoriented or lost is not enjoyable. It fills us with fear and anxiety; it can even lead us to moments of panic.

The same is true in the spiritual realm. Even after we accept Christ, we can get lost, or disoriented, even to the point of never returning to the Lord.

The good news, however, is that God has not left us to ourselves. He has mapped out the road to faith, as revealed in the gospel, and that path includes the law. Many people try to separate the law from the gospel; some even see them as contradictory. Not only is this view wrong, it can have tragic consequences. Without the law, we would have no gospel. It’s hard, really, to understand the gospel without the law.
