### The Lesson in Brief

**Key Text**: <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 6:14">Galatians 6:14</a>

#### The Student Will:

- **Know**: Analyze Paul’s closing comments to the Galatians as they reveal the heart of his passion for the gospel and the church.
- **Feel**: Empathize with Paul’s deep concern over the Galatians’ spiritual condition and their relationships with him and the false teachers.
- **Do**: Boast only in the Cross as the heart of our life and mission.

#### Learning Outline:

1. Know: Large Letters
+ How is the closing of Paul’s letter to the Galatians different from the closings of many of his other letters?
+ What is his most insistent theme in the letter that is reflected in the closing?
+ What is his only boast, and how has he suffered because of this passion?

2. Feel: Not Interested in Impressing
+ If Paul had been interested in making a good impression on the church, how might his ending have been different?
+ What strong feelings are evident in his closing?
+ How might referring to his personal cost and the scars of his mission service on his body have touched the Galatians’ hearts?

3. Do: Our Only Boast
+ What motivation lies at the heart of our lives?
+ What things do we tend to boast about?
+ How would our lives be different if we boasted only of the Cross?

**Summary**: Paul closes his letter to the Galatians with a strong personal appeal, rejecting any outward allegiance to custom and clinging only to the Cross as his reason for life and service, whatever the cost.

#### Learning Cycle

##### STEP 1—Motivate

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Sincere believers boast, not about their achievements but only about the sacrifice that Christ has made in their behalf.

The distinction between authentic Christianity and self-serving religion appears minuscule sometimes. Appearances aside, the divide is gargantuan. Christianity boasts about Christ alone. Self-serving religion speaks glowingly about Christ and churchly achievements. People, even at times ministers, have to be careful about boasting about their spiritual accomplishments, especially in contrast to others who might not, at least on the surface, be as “successful.” Only one comparison, though, is worth noting: Christ versus humanity. Here there is really no comparison. The most distinguished labor, the most eloquent speech, the most accomplished academics, the most polished administration, equals rubbish apart from Christ.

Implicitly contrasting his spiritual approach with his opponents’ self-aggrandizing approaches, Paul declares that his only boast is Christ. Recognizing that only Christ shapes the mission and guarantees its successful accomplishment, Paul acknowledges that human effort, apart from Christ, is nothing. Christ is the beginning. Christ is the conclusion. Christ is everything.

**Opening Activity**: Purchase an inexpensive, easily recognizable figurine from a thrift store. During class, coat the figurine with paint. Discuss how painting affects the shape of the figurine (it changes nothing). While the paint is drying, sprinkle glitter on the figurine. Discuss how the glitter affects the shape (again, it changes nothing). If supplies for this activity are unavailable, describe the activity in your own words, emphasizing the following points: the substance or basic shape of the figurine remains unchanged; therefore, any recognition for the paint and glitter must be secondary, for they would have no shape without the figurine. Christians are the paint and glitter, but Christ is the substance and, therefore, deserves complete glory. Ask: How are believers nothing apart from the Christ figurine, who shapes and vitalizes the church’s mission?

##### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: The Old Testament understanding of glory comes from the concept of weight. Modern languages reflect this understanding.

Slang sometimes refers to criminal leaders as “the heavies.” Another phrase says, “Throw your weight around,” indicating, as with the slang phrase, influence, importance, elevated social position, and widespread authority. The New Testament continues this tradition, applying the term primarily to our heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, and only in a secondary sense to humans (<a class="verse" verse="Luke 12:27">Luke 12:27</a>, <a class="verse" verse="John 7:18">John 7:18</a>). Glory, authority, perfection— that is, “weight”—belongs to God. By comparison, humanity’s noblest achievements are filthy.

**Bible Commentary**

**I. Boasting in the Cross** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 6:14">Galatians 6:14</a> with the class.)

Paul boasted about the suffering and shame represented by the cross. The most despised criminals received crucifixion. A more ignominious demise did not exist. Were Paul plebeian, outcast, educationally deficient, or religiously scorned, his identification with crucifixion might be understandable. We readily understand why persons of impoverished upbringing become social revolutionaries, but Paul’s identification with crucifixion defies reasoning. His personal testimony was “I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless. But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ” (<a class="verse" verse="Phil 3:4–8">Phil. 3:4–8</a>, ESV). Paul was the ultimate insider, possessing the most impressive religious, educational, and social credentials available. Nevertheless, Paul’s boast became nothing other than Christ Himself. His writing demonstrates remarkable consistency about this point. Galatians, written early in Paul’s ministry, exclaims that Paul glories only in the cross. Philippians, written during his later imprisonment, states the same. Paul, writer of more than a dozen New Testament letters, the most celebrated first-century Christian missionary, the framer of New Testament theology, counted all his accomplishments but rubbish, seeking no praise for himself but everything for Jesus.

**Consider This**: Whenever Christians share their testimonies, do they center more on themselves than upon Christ’s work? Why is self-crucifixion so difficult? What dangers are inherent to emphasizing self-esteem? From where should Christians draw their sense of worthiness?

**II. A New Creation** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 5:2–4">Galatians 5:2–4</a> with the class.)

Unfortunately, certain Christian theologies equate conversion with changing the jar’s label rather than the contents. Salvation becomes a judicial transaction that introduces another status. Biblical Christianity, however, declares that life content must undergo transformation. Whenever ownership switches from Satan to Christ, a process is initiated that, upon completion, will have revolutionized the individual’s life. While that process involves the believer’s cooperation, because sanctification is never imposed but willingly accepted, Christians should never suppose that their efforts are meritorious. Statues cannot exclaim, “Look what I made of myself!” Statues cannot create themselves any more than Christians can transform themselves. Jeremiah rhetorically questioned, “Can leopards change their spots?” (see <a class="verse" verse="Jer 13:23">Jer. 13:23</a>). Obviously, both testaments agree that believers become new creations through divine grace rather than through self-will and superficial external changes.

**Consider This**: Because Christians cannot change themselves, toward what goal should believers exert their religious efforts and why? Because Bible study and prayer are not inherently meritorious, why should Christians study and pray?

##### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Sports employers measure speed, athleticism, and strength. Concern about measuring, proving, and justifying ourselves often works untold psychological damage. Humanity desperately needs the unconditional acceptance that only Christ offers.

**Thought Questions**:

1. Is God interested primarily in recruiting talent or building relationships? Explain.
2. When we approach God, what should we bring?

**Application Question**:

1. As we read in the commentary, statues cannot exclaim, “Look what I made of myself!” Statues cannot create themselves any more than Christians can transform themselves. How does the grace of God awaken and transform the spiritually dead and lifeless soul into a living, breathing masterpiece?

##### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: Humans observe outward appearances. God considers hearts. Many often make resolutions regarding behaviors they wish to change. What God wants, however, is heart admittance. Once Christ enters human hearts, habits, lifestyles, viewpoints, and behaviors automatically change. Self-centered concerns are supplanted with kingdom directives. Respectability (outward appearance) may exist without integrity (produced by internal transformation), but God is not impressed.

**Activity**: Sing “He Lives” (The Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal, no. 251) or choose another selection from the Glory and Praise section. Invite members to give short responses regarding how the lyrics lead them to praise God rather than themselves.
