            'Rom 6:1–6, 12:1–8': '<h3> <span>Romans 6:1-6</span></h3><p><span><span>6&#xA0;</span>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it? </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be <i>in the likeness</i> of <i>His</i> resurrection, </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>knowing this, that our old man was crucified with <i>Him,</i> that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. </span> </p><h3> <span>Romans 12:1-8</span></h3><p><span><span>12&#xA0;</span>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, <i>which is</i> your reasonable service. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what <i>is</i> that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think <i>of himself</i> more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function, </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>so we, <i>being</i> many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, <i>let us use them:</i> if prophecy, <i>let us prophesy</i> in proportion to our faith; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>or ministry, <i>let us use it</i> in <i>our</i> ministering; he who teaches, in teaching; </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.</span></p>'
            '1 John 2:16': '<h3> <span>1 John 2:16</span></h3><p> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>For all that <i>is</i> in the world&#x2014;the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life&#x2014;is not of the Father but is of the world. </span> </p>'
            'Gal 6:14': '<h3> <span>Galatians 6:14</span></h3><p> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. </span> </p>'
            'Gal 6:15': '<h3> <span>Galatians 6:15</span></h3><p> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation.</span></p>'
            'Phil 3:8': '<h3> <span>Philippians 3:8</span></h3><p> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ </span> </p>'

_<a class="verse" verse="Gal 6:14">Gal. 6:14</a>_

**“But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world” (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 6:14">Gal. 6:14</a>).**

Having exposed the motives that prompted some to insist on circumcision, Paul presents his gospel message to the Galatians one final time, though only in summary form. For Paul, the gospel is based on two fundamental tenets: (1) the centrality of the Cross (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 6:14">Gal. 6:14</a>) and (2) the doctrine of justification (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 6:15">Gal. 6:15</a>). In today’s study the focus is on the former.

Because we live in the twenty-first century, it is difficult for us to comprehend the shock that Paul’s comments about the Cross (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 6:14">Gal. 6:14</a>) originally conveyed. Today the cross of Christ is a common and cherished symbol that evokes positive feelings for most people. In Paul’s day, however, the Cross was not something to boast in but something to be despised. Jews found the idea of a crucified Messiah offensive, and Romans found crucifixion so repulsive that it was not even mentioned as a form of punishment suitable for a Roman citizen. 

The contempt with which the ancient world looked upon the cross of Christ clearly is seen in the earliest drawing of the crucifixion on record. Dating back to the early second century, a piece of ancient graffiti depicts the crucifixion of a man with the head of a donkey. Below the cross and adjacent to a drawing of a man with his hands raised in worship, an inscription reads, “Alexander worships his god.” The point is clear: the cross of Christ is deemed ridiculous. It is in this context that Paul boldly declares that he can boast in nothing other than the cross of Christ! 

`What difference did the cross of Christ make in Paul’s relationship to the world? <a class="verse" verse="Gal 6:14">Gal. 6:14</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Rom 6:1–6, 12:1–8">Rom. 6:1–6, 12:1–8</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Phil 3:8">Phil. 3:8</a>.`

The cross of Christ changes everything for the believer. It challenges us not only to reevaluate how we view ourselves but also how we relate to the world. The world—this present evil age and all that it entails (<a class="verse" verse="1 John 2:16">1 John 2:16</a>)—stands in opposition to God. Because we have died with Christ, the world no longer has the enslaving power it once held over us, and the old life that we once lived for the world is no longer. Following Paul’s analogy, the break between the believer and the world should be as if the two died to each other.

`What has the Cross done to affect your relationship to the world? What difference has it made in your life? How differently do you live now than you did before giving yourself to the Lord, who died for you?`
