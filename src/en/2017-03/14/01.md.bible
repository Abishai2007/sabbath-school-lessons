            '2 Cor 2; 2 Cor 4:10; 2 Cor 5:17; 2 Cor 11:23; 2 Cor 11:29': '<h3> <span>2 Corinthians 2</span></h3><p><span><span>2&#xA0;</span>But I determined this within myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me?</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And I wrote this very thing to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow over those from whom I ought to have joy, having confidence in you all that my joy is <i>the joy</i> of you all. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but all of you to some extent&#x2014;not to be too severe. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>This punishment which <i>was inflicted</i> by the majority <i>is</i> sufficient for such a man, </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>so that, on the contrary, you <i>ought</i> rather to forgive and comfort <i>him</i>, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I urge you to reaffirm <i>your</i> love to him. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>For to this end I also wrote, that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Now whom you forgive anything, I also <i>forgive</i>. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ, </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to <i>preach</i> Christ&#x2019;s gospel, and a door was opened to me by the Lord, </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Now thanks <i>be</i> to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>To the one <i>we are</i> the aroma of death <i>leading</i> to death, and to the other the aroma of life <i>leading</i> to life. And who <i>is</i> sufficient for these things? </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>For we are not, as so many, peddling the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ.</span></p><h3> <span>2 Corinthians 4:10</span></h3><p> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. </span> </p><h3> <span>2 Corinthians 5:17</span></h3><p> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, if anyone <i>is</i> in Christ, <i>he is</i> a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. </span> </p><h3> <span>2 Corinthians 11:23</span></h3><p> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Are they ministers of Christ?&#x2014;I speak as a fool&#x2014;I <i>am</i> more: in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often. </span> </p><h3> <span>2 Corinthians 11:29</span></h3><p> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn <i>with indignation?</i></span></p>'
            'Rom 6:1–6, 12:1–8': '<h3> <span>Romans 6:1-6</span></h3><p><span><span>6&#xA0;</span>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it? </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be <i>in the likeness</i> of <i>His</i> resurrection, </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>knowing this, that our old man was crucified with <i>Him,</i> that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. </span> </p><h3> <span>Romans 12:1-8</span></h3><p><span><span>12&#xA0;</span>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, <i>which is</i> your reasonable service. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what <i>is</i> that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think <i>of himself</i> more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function, </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>so we, <i>being</i> many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, <i>let us use them:</i> if prophecy, <i>let us prophesy</i> in proportion to our faith; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>or ministry, <i>let us use it</i> in <i>our</i> ministering; he who teaches, in teaching; </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.</span></p>'
            'Galatians 6:14': '<h3> <span>Galatians 6:14</span></h3><p> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. </span> </p>'
            'Jer 9:23, 24': '<h3> <span>Jeremiah 9:23</span></h3><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>:</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Let not the wise <i>man</i> glory in his wisdom,</span><br><span>Let not the mighty <i>man</i> glory in his might,</span><br><span>Nor let the rich <i>man</i> glory in his riches;</span></p><h3> <span>Jeremiah 9:24</span></h3><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>But let him who glories glory in this,</span><br><span>That he understands and knows Me,</span><br><span>That I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, exercising lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth.</span><br><span>For in these I delight,&#x201D; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p>'
            'Gal 6:11–18': '<h3> <span>Galatians 6:11-18</span></h3><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand! </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, these <i>would</i> compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>For not even those who are circumcised keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy <i>be</i> upon them, and upon the Israel of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with your spirit.

> “But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world”(<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 6:14">Galatians 6:14</a>, ESV).

This study of Galatians has been intense. That is because the letter itself is intense. Knowing Paul’s calling, knowing the truth of what he preached (after all, as he said numerous times, that truth came from the Lord), Paul wrote with the inspired passion of the Old Testament prophets, of an Isaiah, a Jeremiah, a Hosea. Just as they pleaded with the people of God in their time to turn away from their error, Paul here is doing the same with those in his time.

We can see this similarity is true when considering that no matter how different the immediate circumstances were, in the end the words of Jeremiah could just as easily apply to the Galatians as they did to those in Jeremiah’s day: “Thus saith the Lord, let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord” (<a class="verse" verse="Jer 9:23, 24">Jer. 9:23, 24</a>).

Nowhere do our “glorious” human wisdom, our riches, or our might appear more clearly in all their futility and vanity than before the cross of Christ—the focus of Paul’s letter to his erring flock in Galatia.
