            'Galatians 6': '<h3> <span>Galatians 6</span></h3><p><span><span>6&#xA0;</span>Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who <i>are</i> spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Bear one another&#x2019;s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>For each one shall bear his own load.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand! </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, these <i>would</i> compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>For not even those who are circumcised keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy <i>be</i> upon them, and upon the Israel of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with your spirit.

“The Spirit of God keeps evil under the control of conscience. When man exalts himself above the influence of the Spirit, he reaps a harvest of iniquity. Over such a man the Spirit has less and less influence to restrain him from sowing seeds of disobedience. Warnings have less and less power over him. He gradually loses his fear of God. He sows to the flesh; he will reap corruption. The harvest of the seed that he himself has sown, is ripening. He has a contempt for God’s holy commandments. His heart of flesh becomes a heart of stone. Resistance to truth confirms him in iniquity. It is because men sowed seeds of evil, that lawlessness, crime, and violence prevailed in the antediluvian world.

“All should be intelligent in regard to the agency by which the soul is destroyed. It is not because of any decree that God has sent out against man. He does not make man spiritually blind. God gives sufficient light and evidence to enable man to distinguish truth from error. But He does not force man to receive truth. He leaves him free to choose the good or to choose the evil. If man resists evidence that is sufficient to guide his judgment in the right direction, and chooses evil once, he will do this more readily the second time. The third time he will still more eagerly withdraw himself from God and choose to stand on the side of Satan. And in this course he will continue until he is confirmed in evil, and believes the lie he has cherished as truth. His resistance has produced its harvest (MS 126, 1901).”—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1112.

#### Discussion Question

`In a practical sense, what does it really mean to “restore” a fellow believer who has fallen into sin? In what ways does the nature of the sin committed affect the restoration process? Does restoration mean that everything will be the same as before? Discuss.`

`Because there are some burdens that people must bear on their own (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 6:5">Gal. 6:5</a>), how does a believer determine if he or she should try to help someone?`

`How does your church measure up to Paul’s instructions in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 6">Galatians 6</a>? What can you do personally to make a difference?`

**Summary**: The indication of God’s presence among His people is in the Christlike spirit manifest within the church. It can be seen in the way forgiveness and restoration are extended to those who err, in how they help each other in trials, and in intentional acts of kindness shared not only among themselves but also with unbelievers.
