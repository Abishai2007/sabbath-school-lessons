            'Galatians 6:6–10': '<h3> <span>Galatians 6:6-10</span></h3><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.</span></p>'
            'Galatians 6:10': '<h3> <span>Galatians 6:10</span></h3><p> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.</span></p>'
            'Galatians 6:1': '<h3> <span>Galatians 6:1</span></h3><p><span><span>6&#xA0;</span>Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who <i>are</i> spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted. </span> </p>'
            'John 8': '<h3> <span>John 8</span></h3><p><span><span>8&#xA0;</span>But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Now early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him; and He sat down and taught them. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>they said to Him, &#x201C;Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>This they said, testing Him, that they might have <i>something</i> of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with <i>His</i> finger, as though He did not hear.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, <span>&#x201C;He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then those who heard <i>it,</i> being convicted by <i>their</i> conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest <i>even</i> to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, <span>&#x201C;Woman, where are those accusers of yours?</span><span> Has no one condemned you?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>She said, &#x201C;No one, Lord.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>And Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Neither do I condemn you; go and</span> <span>sin no more.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, <span>&#x201C;I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>The Pharisees therefore said to Him, &#x201C;You bear witness of Yourself; Your witness is not true.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, <span>&#x201C;Even if I bear witness of Myself, My witness is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from and where I am going.</span> </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup><span>You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.</span> </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup><span>And yet if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I <i>am</i> with the Father who sent Me.</span> </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup><span>It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.</span> </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup><span>I am One who bears witness of Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness of Me.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Then they said to Him, &#x201C;Where is Your Father?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jesus answered, <span>&#x201C;You know neither Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no one laid hands on Him, for His hour had not yet come.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus said to them again, <span>&#x201C;I am going away, and you will seek Me, and will die in your sin. Where I go you cannot come.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>So the Jews said, &#x201C;Will He kill Himself, because He says, <span>&#x2018;Where I go you cannot come&#x2019;</span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And He said to them, <span>&#x201C;You are from beneath; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</span> </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup><span>Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am <i>He,</i> you will die in your sins.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Then they said to Him, &#x201C;Who are You?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>And Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.</span> </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup><span>I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I heard from Him.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>They did not understand that He spoke to them of the Father.</span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am <i>He,</i> and <i>that</i> I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things.</span> </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup><span>And He who sent Me is with Me. The Father has not left Me alone, for I always do those things that please Him.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>As He spoke these words, many believed in Him.</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, <span>&#x201C;If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed.</span> </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup><span>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>They answered Him, &#x201C;We are Abraham&#x2019;s descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How <i>can</i> You say, <span>&#x2018;You will be made free&#x2019;</span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Jesus answered them, <span>&#x201C;Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave of sin.</span> </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup><span>And a slave does not abide in the house forever, <i>but</i> a son abides forever.</span> </span> <span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup><span>Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.</span></span></p><p><span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;I know that you are Abraham&#x2019;s descendants, but you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you.</span> </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup><span>I speak what I have seen with My Father, and you do what you have seen with</span><span> your father.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>They answered and said to Him, &#x201C;Abraham is our father.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;If you were Abraham&#x2019;s children, you would do the works of Abraham.</span> </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup><span>But now you seek to kill Me, a Man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.</span> </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup><span>You do the deeds of your father.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span>Then they said to Him, &#x201C;We were not born of fornication; we have one Father&#x2014;God.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me.</span> </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup><span>Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word.</span> </span> <span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup><span>You are of <i>your</i> father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own <i>resources,</i> for he is a liar and the father of it.</span> </span> <span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup><span>But because I tell the truth, you do not believe Me.</span> </span> <span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup><span>Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me?</span> </span> <span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup><span>He who is of God hears God&#x2019;s words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>Then the Jews answered and said to Him, &#x201C;Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>49&#xA0;</sup>Jesus answered, <span>&#x201C;I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.</span> </span> <span><sup>50&#xA0;</sup><span>And I do not seek My <i>own</i> glory; there is One who seeks and judges.</span> </span> <span><sup>51&#xA0;</sup><span>Most assuredly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word he shall never see death.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>52&#xA0;</sup>Then the Jews said to Him, &#x201C;Now we know that You have a demon! Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and You say, <span>&#x2018;If anyone keeps My word he shall never taste death.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>53&#xA0;</sup>Are You greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? And the prophets are dead. Who do You make Yourself out to be?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>54&#xA0;</sup>Jesus answered, <span>&#x201C;If I honor Myself, My honor is nothing. It is My Father who honors Me, of whom you say that He is your</span><span> God.</span> </span> <span><sup>55&#xA0;</sup><span>Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I say, &#x2018;I do not know Him,&#x2019; I shall be a liar like you; but I do know Him and keep His word.</span> </span> <span><sup>56&#xA0;</sup><span>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw <i>it</i> and was glad.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>57&#xA0;</sup>Then the Jews said to Him, &#x201C;You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>58&#xA0;</sup>Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>59&#xA0;</sup>Then they took up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</span></p>'

### The Lesson in Brief

**Key Text**: <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 6:10">Galatians 6:10</a>

#### The Student Will

- **Know**: Review the ways in which living in and through Christ instructs the ways in which we relate to others.
- **Feel**: Sense the dangers that spiritual pride carries, especially for Christians who believe themselves safe from temptation.
- **Do**: Love our neighbors as we care for ourselves, thus fulfilling the law of Christ.

#### Learning Outline:

1. Know: Doing Good
+ How should Christians relate to their brothers and sisters who have stumbled?
+ Why is it especially important to treat others who are burdened as we would like to be treated?

2. Feel: Spiritual Pride
+ Why is spiritual pride such a danger to Christians?
+ How can we guard against an indifferent, cold, critical spirit?
+ Why is a thoughtful self-examination and evaluation important?
+ What biblical examples illustrate the perils of thinking too much of our own abilities?

3. Do: The Law of Christ
+ How does loving our neighbor fulfill the law of Christ?
+ Where do our greatest challenges arise in bearing one another’s burdens?
+ What family members do we need to serve in this way?
+ What gender, racial, tribal, or class prejudices do we carry that need to be eradicated?

**Summary**: When the law of Christ is fulfilled in our lives, we will care for those who have fallen and who are burdened. We will recognize our own weaknesses and humbly submit to every evidence of truth, lest we become spiritually proud and blind.

#### Learning Cycle

#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: God has commissioned the church as His transforming agent upon the earth.

The omnipotent Savior might have bypassed humanity when reaching the lost world. What could sinful, weakened, vacillating humans contribute to this noble enterprise? Dispatch the sinless angelic host, mobilize the faithful creatures from other galaxies, or utilize divine remote controls: the omnipotent, omniscient Creator of the universe had these and thousands of additional options at His disposal. Nevertheless, He included the fellowship of redeemed individuals, the church, as His distributing agency.

Care should be exercised in expressing this truth. The church has the privilege and opportunity of sharing and modeling the gospel before fallen humanity. This sacred responsibility, however, is not proprietary. Humans do not possess franchise authority, and they cannot deny access to God. The Holy Spirit is God’s primary disseminator of grace with the church, assuming the role of cooperating agency. Rather than denying access to God, the church’s work is to expand access. What glorious opportunities! The church works hand in hand with God to evangelize and nurture fallen human beings. Miraculous transformation and reformation occur constantly within this divinely originated and ordained fellowship. Changed lives, restored relationships, guilt-free consciences, and spiritual support form only a portion of the benefits enjoyed through association with God’s church.

**Opening Activity**: Every new day brings renewed hope. Fresh opportunities, coupled with release from the previous day’s missteps and mistakes, can make each day a much-anticipated and celebrated event. Share print media articles, newscast downloads, and/or other information about new beginnings from current sources. Discuss why the prospect of something new generates widespread interest and high expectations. Compare the church’s role in pointing us to the Lord, who provides release from prior mistakes and a chance to start afresh, forgiven and cleansed.

**Just for Teachers**: Scripture proclaims release for captives, release from condemnation, and freedom from dominating propensities. This remains heaven’s highest work. Jesus sacrificed everything at Calvary and then commissioned His representatives (the church), energized through His abiding Spirit, to enlighten a darkened planet with spiritual expectation. That expectation includes forgiveness for every transgression, deliverance from every imaginable temptation, and an increasing intimacy with God through which our lives are continuously transformed and renewed. Believers find meaning through assisting newer believers with encouragement, stimulating the confidence that matures only whenever obstacles have been encountered and overcome successfully.

**Bible Commentary**

**I. Restoring the Fallen** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 6:1">Galatians 6:1</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 18:15–17">Matthew 18:15–17</a> with the class.)

The church’s constant objective is restoration, not condemnation. Many understand the terminology of church discipline punitively. Well-intentioned members, zealous to protect the church’s reputation, declare that the erring must be separated in order to avoid contamination. This is a very dangerous approach. The religious leadership of Christ’s time was anxious about condemning the adulterous woman in <a class="verse" verse="John 8">John 8</a>; but were they themselves sinless? Had they no need for forgiveness? Was there no divine condemnation for their hypocrisy? Perhaps the notion of protecting the church’s reputation needs reexamination. Compare the work of a hospital. Hospitals exist for the purpose of physical healing and restoration. Does every patient leave the hospital alive? Obviously not. Does the presence of occasional casualties nullify the hospital’s mission and purpose? Would your community declare that the local hospital should close because it lost a patient? Should hospitals limit their services to those with common colds and other easily curable diseases in order to enhance their track records and bolster their reputations, turning away trauma patients, cancer victims, and other difficult cases? Rather than dismissing difficult cases, physicians aggressively tackle them, researching new methodologies and techniques to effect healing. Disease is meticulously studied, new therapies are developed, and yesterday’s death-sentence diseases become today’s miraculous breakthroughs.

Perhaps those who work with spiritual illness should adopt a similar attitude. Thus, discipline would become redemptive rather than punitive, and the church’s reputation would rest upon the compassionate and aggressively creative way that believers fight the sin disease. Christians should forcefully battle sin, not sinners. Obviously, some will be lost. But should churches start limiting their ministry to good citizen types in order to bolster their success rate, their action would prove that they have forgotten their purpose. Discipline, in Paul’s usage, refers to training in righteousness. It is a series of actions or behaviors whose objective is forming a more intimate relationship with God. Far from being punitive, Paul’s discipline is restorative and positive. Like fine-tuned triage units, churches become centers for cooperation and accountability in achieving a common goal: the healing of sin-scarred hearts through the life-giving love of God.

**Consider This**: What should characterize the attitude of those who take up the work of visiting backsliders? How did Jesus approach the fallen? How can Christians safeguard themselves against the temptations from which they would rescue the fallen? What does sharing one another’s burdens mean?

**II. Sowing and Reaping** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 6:6–10">Galatians 6:6–10</a> with the class.)

In the context of bearing one’s burdens or responsibilities, Paul urged the responsibility of supporting the teachers who proclaimed sound doctrine. Using proverbial language familiar to his readers, he urged them to make sound investments because those who expected a bountiful harvest must plant abundantly. While the immediate context regards the material support of teachers, the text enjoys an even wider spiritual application. Spiritual attainments are proportionate with spiritual investments. Those who desire greater spiritual strength must engage in spiritual exercise and avoid spiritual fast food. Little investment equals little advancement. Spiritual profitability arises from investing time with spiritual things.

**Consider This**: Whenever believers’ lives are dominated by secular media— television, radio, Internet, and so on—how can they expect significant spiritual progress? What should dominate the Christian’s time should he/she desire intimate fellowship with God? How can Christians invest themselves spiritually in others, especially those who are not yet believers?

##### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Those concerned about their financial future understand the value of investment planning and are willing to expend significant financial resources in order to maximize the return on their investments. Sadly, churches often proceed haphazardly about business that far exceeds finances in importance. Christ’s sacrifice was infinitely more valuable than the world’s pooled monetary worth; yet, believers randomly, rather than intentionally, approach the work of investing in the lives of nonbelievers. Through the eyes of the following exercise, seek to cultivate intentionality about spiritual investments that reach the spiritually drifting souls in your community.

**Activity**: Create a deck of cards from plain 3 x 5 cards (minimum: 10). On each card, list a phrase that expresses one means by which the church can transform society. Focus on methods that your church has employed or those offering the most potential for your community. Have members pick cards at random. They should read the card and express the concept in their own words. Have them evaluate the effectiveness of the concept in terms of the church’s work of spiritual transformation using a numerical scale from 0 through 10 (10 being optimal and 0 representing total ineffectiveness). Members should justify their evaluations by offering their reasoning to the entire class, who, in turn, should offer their observations.

Gather the salient points and develop a profile of those characteristics that best prepare the church for its role of spiritual transformation. The list should not be limited to the following assortment of activities and approaches. Use whatever is appropriate and omit the rest. List: (1) distributing literature, (2) children’s summer camps, (3) parent-sitting the elderly, (4) inviting neighbors to evangelistic meetings, (5) visiting the imprisoned, (6) visiting the homebound, (7) coaching children’s baseball, (8) street-corner preaching, (9) door-to-door evangelism, (10) offering health classes, (11) acquiring clothing and basic necessities for the destitute and disadvantaged, (12) forgiving a fellow member for unkind words spoken, (13) mending a child’s pants, (14) taking single-parent children picnicking, (15) sharing with neighbors about Sabbath keeping.

##### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: While planning and committees are valuable tools, the church never transformed a life in a committee meeting (never say never, but you understand the point). Merely talking about the gospel’s transforming power (as in a Sabbath School discussion) does little to fulfill the gospel commission. Challenge your class to get outside the walls and into the streets, making a difference in those ways in which God has uniquely equipped your class.

**Activity**: Develop an approach to some community need during the final phase of your Sabbath School that the class commits to carry out. Set actual dates, times, and deadlines for accomplishing various phases of your endeavor.
