            'Genesis 28': '<h3> <span>Genesis 28</span></h3><p><span><span>28&#xA0;</span>Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him: &#x201C;You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Arise, go to Padan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother&#x2019;s father; and take yourself a wife from there of the daughters of Laban your mother&#x2019;s brother.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;May God Almighty bless you,</span><br><span>And make you fruitful and multiply you,</span><br><span>That you may be an assembly of peoples;</span><br><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And give you the blessing of Abraham,</span><br><span>To you and your descendants with you,</span><br><span>That you may inherit the land</span><br><span>In which you are a stranger,</span><br><span>Which God gave to Abraham.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>So Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Padan Aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Padan Aram to take himself a wife from there, <i>and that</i> as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, &#x201C;You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Padan Aram. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Also Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan did not please his father Isaac. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham&#x2019;s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife in addition to the wives he had.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Now Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>So he came to a certain place and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. And he took one of the stones of that place and put it at his head, and he lay down in that place to sleep. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Then he dreamed, and behold, a ladder <i>was</i> set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And behold, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> stood above it and said: &#x201C;I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and your descendants. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Also your descendants shall be as the dust of the earth; you shall spread abroad to the west and the east, to the north and the south; and in you and in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Behold, I <i>am</i> with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have spoken to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, &#x201C;Surely the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> is in this place, and I did not know <i>it.</i>&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>And he was afraid and said, &#x201C;How awesome <i>is</i> this place! This <i>is</i> none other than the house of God, and this <i>is</i> the gate of heaven!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Then Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put at his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And he called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of that city had been Luz previously. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Then Jacob made a vow, saying, &#x201C;If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I am going, and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on, </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>so that I come back to my father&#x2019;s house in peace, then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> shall be my God. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>And this stone which I have set as a pillar shall be God&#x2019;s house, and of all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You.&#x201D;</span></p>'
            'Acts 7:38': '<h3> <span>Acts 7:38</span></h3><p><span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the Angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and <i>with</i> our fathers, the one who received the living oracles to give to us, </span> </p>'
            'Acts 7:53': '<h3> <span>Acts 7:53</span></h3><p> <span><sup>53&#xA0;</sup>who have received the law by the direction of angels and have not kept <i>it.</i>&#x201D;</span></p>'
            'Genesis 3': '<h3> <span>Genesis 3</span></h3><p><span><span>3&#xA0;</span>Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God had made.

She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they <i>were</i> naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And they heard the sound of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God among the trees of the garden.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God called to Adam and said to him, &#x201C;Where <i>are</i> you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>So he said, &#x201C;I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And He said, &#x201C;Who told you that you <i>were</i> naked?

            'Heb 2:2': '<h3> <span>Hebrews 2:2</span></h3><p> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just reward, </span> </p>'
            'Acts 9': '<h3> <span>Acts 9</span></h3><p><span><span>9&#xA0;</span>Then Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>and asked letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>As he journeyed he came near Damascus, and suddenly a light shone around him from heaven. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Then he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, <span>&#x201C;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And he said, &#x201C;Who are You, Lord?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then the Lord said, <span>&#x201C;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</span> <span>It <i>is</i> hard for you to kick against the goads.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>So he, trembling and astonished, said, &#x201C;Lord, what do You want me to do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then the Lord <i>said</i> to him, <span>&#x201C;Arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice but seeing no one. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened he saw no one. But they led him by the hand and brought <i>him</i> into Damascus. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and to him the Lord said in a vision, <span>&#x201C;Ananias.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span>And he said, &#x201C;Here I am, Lord.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>So the Lord <i>said</i> to him, <span>&#x201C;Arise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for <i>one</i> called Saul of Tarsus, for behold, he is praying.</span> </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup><span>And in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and putting <i>his</i> hand on him, so that he might receive his sight.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Then Ananias answered, &#x201C;Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your name.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>But the Lord said to him, <span>&#x201C;Go, for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel.</span> </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup><span>For I will show him how many things he must suffer for My name&#x2019;s sake.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and laying his hands on him he said, &#x201C;Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Immediately there fell from his eyes <i>something</i> like scales, and he received his sight at once; and he arose and was baptized.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>So when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then Saul spent some days with the disciples at Damascus.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Immediately he preached the Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Then all who heard were amazed, and said, &#x201C;Is this not he who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and has come here for that purpose, so that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this <i>Jesus</i> is the Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Now after many days were past, the Jews plotted to kill him. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>But their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night, to kill him. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Then the disciples took him by night and let <i>him</i> down through the wall in a large basket.</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And when Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, and did not believe that he was a disciple. </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>But Barnabas took him and brought <i>him</i> to the apostles. And he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>So he was with them at Jerusalem, coming in and going out. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the Hellenists, but they attempted to kill him. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>When the brethren found out, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him out to Tarsus.</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Then the churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and were edified. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.</span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>Now it came to pass, as Peter went through all <i>parts of the country,</i> that he also came down to the saints who dwelt in Lydda. </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years and was paralyzed. </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>And Peter said to him, &#x201C;Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals you. Arise and make your bed.&#x201D; Then he arose immediately. </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>So all who dwelt at Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.</span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>At Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and charitable deeds which she did. </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>But it happened in those days that she became sick and died. When they had washed her, they laid <i>her</i> in an upper room. </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>And since Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him, imploring <i>him</i> not to delay in coming to them. </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter arose and went with them. When he had come, they brought <i>him</i> to the upper room. And all the widows stood by him weeping, showing the tunics and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them. </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>But Peter put them all out, and knelt down and prayed. And turning to the body he said, &#x201C;Tabitha, arise.&#x201D; And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up. </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>Then he gave her <i>his</i> hand and lifted her up; and when he had called the saints and widows, he presented her alive. </span> <span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord. </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>So it was that he stayed many days in Joppa with Simon, a tanner.</span></p>'

**“ ‘He was in the assembly in the desert, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living words to pass on to us’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 7:38">Acts 7:38</a>, NIV).**

In <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:19, 20">Galatians 3:19, 20</a>, Paul continues his train of thought about the law not nullifying the covenant of grace. This is important because if the theology of his opponents were correct, the law would do just that. Think, then, what our position as sinners would be if we had to rely on our law-keeping, as opposed to God’s grace, to save us. We would, in the end, be without hope.

Although the details of Paul’s comments in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:19, 20">Galatians 3:19, 20</a> are difficult, his basic point is clear: the law is subsidiary to the promise, because it was mediated through angels and Moses. The connection of angels to the giving of the law is not mentioned in Exodus, but it is found in several other places in Scripture (<a class="verse" verse="Deut 33:2">Deut. 33:2</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Acts 7:53">Acts 7:53</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Heb 2:2">Heb. 2:2</a>). Paul uses the word mediator in <a class="verse" verse="1 Timothy 2:5">1 Timothy 2:5</a> in reference to Christ, but his comments here strongly suggest he has <a class="verse" verse="Deuteronomy 5:5">Deuteronomy 5:5</a> (ESV) in mind, in which Moses says, “I stood between the Lord and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the Lord.”

As majestic as the giving of the law was on Sinai, with countless angels in attendance, and as important as Moses was in the presentation of the law at that time, the giving of the law was indirect. In stark contrast, God’s promise was made directly to Abraham (and, therefore, to all believers), for there was no need for a mediator. In the end, however important the law, it is no substitute for the promise of salvation through grace by faith. On the contrary, the law helps us better understand just how wonderful that promise really is.

`Describe the nature of Abraham’s direct encounters with God. What benefit was there to such immediacy with God? Consider <a class="verse" verse="Gen 15:1; Gen 15:6; Gen 18:1; Gen 18:33; Gen 22:1; Gen 22:18">Gen. 15:1; Gen. 15:6; Gen. 18:1; Gen. 18:33; Gen. 22:1; Gen. 22:18</a>; .`

`Think about some of the other encounters people in the Bible had with God: Adam and Eve in Eden (<a class="verse" verse="Genesis 3">Genesis 3</a>), Jacob and the ladder in his dream (<a class="verse" verse="Genesis 28">Genesis 28</a>), and Paul on the road to Damascus (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 9">Acts 9</a>). Maybe you haven’t experienced anything as dramatic, but in what ways has God revealed Himself to you? Ask yourself, too, whether anything in your personal life might prevent you from having the kind of intimacy and immediacy that Abraham experienced with God. If so, what steps can you take to change?`
