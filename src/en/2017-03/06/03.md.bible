            'Rom 7:7, 12; 8:3': '<h3> <span>Romans 7:7</span></h3><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>What shall we say then? <i>Is</i> the law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, <span>&#x201C;You shall not covet.&#x201D;</span> </span> </p><h3> <span>Romans 7:12</span></h3><p> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the law <i>is</i> holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.</span></p><h3> <span>Romans 8:3</span></h3><p> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God <i>did</i> by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, </span> </p>'
            'Matt 5:17–20': '<h3> <span>Matthew 5:17-20</span></h3><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.</span> </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup><span>For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.</span> </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup><span>Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches <i>them,</i> he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup><span>For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds <i>the righteousness</i> of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.</span></span></p>'
            '1 Cor 6:13': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 6:13</span></h3><p> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body <i>is</i> not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. </span> </p>'
            'Romans 3:31': '<h3> <span>Romans 3:31</span></h3><p> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law.</span></p>'

            'Eph 2:15': '<h3> <span>Ephesians 2:15</span></h3><p> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>having abolished in His flesh the enmity, <i>that is,</i> the law of commandments <i>contained</i> in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man <i>from</i> the two, <i>thus</i> making peace, </span> </p>'
            'Gal 2:16': '<h3> <span>Galatians 2:16</span></h3><p> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</span></p>'
            'Rom 3:3': '<h3> <span>Romans 3:3</span></h3><p> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief make the faithfulness of God without effect? </span> </p>'
            'Gal 3:7': '<h3> <span>Galatians 3:7</span></h3><p> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore know that <i>only</i> those who are of faith are sons of Abraham. </span> </p>'
            'Rom 6:6': '<h3> <span>Romans 6:6</span></h3><p> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>knowing this, that our old man was crucified with <i>Him,</i> that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. </span> </p>'
            'Romans 3': '<h3> <span>Romans 3</span></h3><p><span><span>3&#xA0;</span>What advantage then has the Jew, or what <i>is</i> the profit of circumcision? </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Much in every way! Chiefly because to them were committed the oracles of God. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief make the faithfulness of God without effect? </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Certainly not! Indeed, let God be true but every man a liar.

_<a class="verse" verse="Rom 3:31">Rom. 3:31</a>_

Paul has argued strongly for the supremacy of faith in a person’s relationship with God. He has repeatedly stated that neither circumcision nor any other “works of law” are a prerequisite to salvation, “because by works of the law no one will be justified” (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 2:16">Gal. 2:16</a>, ESV). Moreover, it is not the works of the law but faith that is the defining mark of the believer (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 3:7">Gal. 3:7</a>). This repeated negation of the works of the law raises the question, “Does the law have absolutely no value then? Did God do away with the law?”

`Because salvation is by faith and not by works of law, does Paul mean to say that faith abolishes the law? What do the following texts tell us? Compare <a class="verse" verse="Rom 3:31">Rom. 3:31</a> with <a class="verse" verse="Rom 7:7, 12; 8:3">Rom. 7:7, 12; 8:3</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Matt 5:17–20">Matt. 5:17–20</a>.`

Paul’s argument in <a class="verse" verse="Romans 3">Romans 3</a> parallels his discussion about faith and law in Galatians. Sensing that his comments might lead some to conclude that he is exalting faith at the expense of the law, Paul asks the rhetorical question, “Do we then overthrow the law by this faith?” (ESV). The word translated as “overthrow” in <a class="verse" verse="Romans 3:31">Romans 3:31</a> (ESV) is katargeo. Paul uses the word frequently, and it can be translated as “to nullify” (<a class="verse" verse="Rom 3:3">Rom. 3:3</a>, ESV), “to abolish” (<a class="verse" verse="Eph 2:15">Eph. 2:15</a>), “to be brought to nothing” (<a class="verse" verse="Rom 6:6">Rom. 6:6</a>, ESV), or even “to destroy” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 6:13">1 Cor. 6:13</a>). Clearly, if Paul wanted to endorse the idea that the law was somehow done away with at the cross, as some people today claim he taught, this would have been the time. But Paul not only denies that sentiment with an emphatic no, he actually states that his gospel “establishes” the law!

“The plan of justification by faith reveals God’s regard for His law in demanding and providing the atoning sacrifice. If justification by faith abolishes law, then there was no need for the atoning death of Christ to release the sinner from his sins, and thus restore him to peace with God.

“Moreover, genuine faith implies in itself an unreserved willingness to fulfill the will of God in a life of obedience to His law. . . . Real faith, based on wholehearted love for the Saviour, can lead only to obedience.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 510.

`Think through the implications if Paul did, indeed, mean that faith nullifies the need to keep the law. Would adultery then, for instance, no longer be sin? What about stealing, or even murder? Think about the sorrow, pain, and suffering you could spare yourself if you merely obeyed God’s law. What suffering have you or others gone through as a result of disobedience to God’s law?`
