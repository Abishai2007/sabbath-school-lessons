        verses:
            'Exod 16:22–26': '<h3> <span>Exodus 16:22-26</span></h3><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>And so it was, on the sixth day, <i>that</i> they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Then he said to them, &#x201C;This <i>is what</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has said: &#x2018;Tomorrow <i>is</i> a Sabbath rest, a holy Sabbath to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. Bake what you will bake <i>today,</i> and boil what you will boil; and lay up for yourselves all that remains, to be kept until morning.&#x2019;&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>So they laid it up till morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not stink, nor were there any worms in it. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Then Moses said, &#x201C;Eat that today, for today <i>is</i> a Sabbath to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>; today you will not find it in the field. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none.&#x201D;</span></p>'
            'Galatians 3:18': '<h3> <span>Galatians 3:18</span></h3><p> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For if the inheritance <i>is</i> of the law, <i>it is</i> no longer of promise; but God gave <i>it</i> to Abraham by promise.</span></p>'
            'Matt 5:17–20': '<h3> <span>Matthew 5:17-20</span></h3><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.</span> </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup><span>For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.</span> </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup><span>Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches <i>them,</i> he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup><span>For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds <i>the righteousness</i> of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.</span></span></p>'
            'Gal 3:15–20': '<h3> <span>Galatians 3:15-20</span></h3><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though <i>it is</i> only a man&#x2019;s covenant, yet <i>if it is</i> confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, &#x201C;And to seeds,&#x201D; as of many, but as of one, <span>&#x201C;And to your Seed,&#x201D;</span> who is Christ. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>And this I say, <i>that</i> the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For if the inheritance <i>is</i> of the law, <i>it is</i> no longer of promise; but God gave <i>it</i> to Abraham by promise.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>What purpose then <i>does</i> the law <i>serve?</i> It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; <i>and it was</i> appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Now a mediator does not <i>mediate</i> for one <i>only,</i> but God is one.</span></p>'
            'Gen 9:11–17': '<h3> <span>Genesis 9:11-17</span></h3><p> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Thus I establish My covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood; never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And God said: &#x201C;This <i>is</i> the sign of the covenant which I make between Me and you, and every living creature that <i>is</i> with you, for perpetual generations: </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>It shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud; </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>and I will remember My covenant which <i>is</i> between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will look on it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that <i>is</i> on the earth.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>And God said to Noah, &#x201C;This <i>is</i> the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that <i>is</i> on the earth.&#x201D;</span></p>'
            'Gen 15:1–6': '<h3> <span>Genesis 15:1-6</span></h3><p><span><span>15&#xA0;</span>After these things the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> came to Abram in a vision, saying, &#x201C;Do not be afraid, Abram. I <i>am</i> your shield, your exceedingly great reward.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>But Abram said, &#x201C;Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span>, what will You give me, seeing I go childless, and the heir of my house <i>is</i> Eliezer of Damascus?&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then Abram said, &#x201C;Look, You have given me no offspring; indeed one born in my house is my heir!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And behold, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> <i>came</i> to him, saying, &#x201C;This one shall not be your heir, but one who will come from your own body shall be your heir.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Then He brought him outside and said, &#x201C;Look now toward heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them.&#x201D; And He said to him, &#x201C;So shall your descendants be.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And he believed in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and He accounted it to him for righteousness.</span></p>'
            'Isa 46:11': '<h3> <span>Isaiah 46:11</span></h3><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Calling a bird of prey from the east,</span><br><span>The man who executes My counsel, from a far country.</span><br><span>Indeed I have spoken <i>it;</i></span><br><span>I will also bring it to pass.</span><br><span>I have purposed <i>it;</i></span><br><span>I will also do it.</span></p>'

> “For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise” (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:18">Galatians 3:18</a>, ESV).

Someone once asked a politician, “Have you kept all the promises that you made during the campaign?” He responded, “Yes . . . well, at least all the promises that I intended to keep.” Who hasn’t, at one time or another, been at one end or the other of a broken promise? Who hasn’t been the one to break a promise or the one to have a promise made to him or her broken?

Sometimes people make a promise, fully intending to keep it, but, later, don’t; others make a promise, knowing—as the sounds leave their mouths or the letters their fingers—it’s all a lie.

Fortunately for us, God’s promises are of an entirely different order. God’s Word is sure and unchanging. “ ‘I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it,’ ” says the Lord (<a class="verse" verse="Isa 46:11">Isa. 46:11</a>, ESV).

In this week’s lesson, Paul directs our attention to the relationship between God’s promise to Abraham and the law given to Israel 430 years later. How should the relationship between the two be understood, and what implications does that have for the preaching of the gospel?
