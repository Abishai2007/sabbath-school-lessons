_<a class="verse" verse="Gal 3:9–14">Gal. 3:9–14</a>_

Paul’s opponents were no doubt stunned by his bold words in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:10">Galatians 3:10</a>. They certainly did not think themselves to be under a curse; if anything, they expected to be blessed for their obedience. Yet, Paul is unequivocal: “For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them’ ” (NKJV).

Paul is contrasting two completely different alternatives: salvation by faith and salvation by works. The covenant blessings and curses outlined in <a class="verse" verse="Deuteronomy 27">Deuteronomy 27</a> and 28 were straightforward. Those who obeyed were blessed, and those who disobeyed were cursed. That means if we want to rely on obedience to the law for acceptance with God, then the whole law needs to be kept. We do not have the liberty to pick and choose what we want to follow; we also should not assume that God is willing to overlook a few mistakes here and there. It is all or nothing.

This is, of course, bad news not only for Gentiles but for Paul’s legalistic opponents as well, because we “all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (<a class="verse" verse="Rom 3:23">Rom. 3:23</a>). No matter how hard we try to be good, the law can only condemn us as lawbreakers.

`How did Christ deliver us from the curse of the law? See <a class="verse" verse="Gal 3:13">Gal. 3:13</a> and <a class="verse" verse="2 Cor 5:21">2 Cor. 5:21</a>.`

Paul introduces another metaphor to explain what God has done for us in Christ in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:13">Galatians 3:13</a>. The word redeem means “to buy back.” It was used to refer to the ransom price paid to release hostages or the price paid to free a slave. Because the wages of sin is death, the curse of failing to keep the law was often a death sentence. The ransom paid for our salvation was not insignificant; it cost God the life of His own Son (<a class="verse" verse="John 3:16">John 3:16</a>). Jesus ransomed us from the curse by becoming our sin-bearer (<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 6:20, 7:23">1 Cor. 6:20, 7:23</a>). He voluntarily took our curse upon Himself and suffered in our behalf the full penalty of sin (<a class="verse" verse="2 Cor 5:21">2 Cor. 5:21</a>).

Paul cites <a class="verse" verse="Deuteronomy 21:23">Deuteronomy 21:23</a> as scriptural proof. According to Jewish custom, a person was under God’s curse if, after execution, the body was hung on a tree. Jesus’ death on the cross was seen as an example of this curse (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 5:30">Acts 5:30</a>, <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:24">1 Pet. 2:24</a>).

No wonder, then, that the Cross was a stumbling block for some Jews who could not fathom the idea that the Messiah was accursed by God. But this was exactly God’s plan. Yes, the Messiah bore a curse, but it was not His own—it was ours!
