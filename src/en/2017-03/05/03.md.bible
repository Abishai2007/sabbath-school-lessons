            'Galatians 3:6–4:31': '<h3> <span>Galatians 3:6-4:31</span></h3><p> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>just as Abraham <span>&#x201C;believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore know that <i>only</i> those who are of faith are sons of Abraham. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, <i>saying,</i> <span>&#x201C;In you all the nations shall be blessed.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>So then those who <i>are</i> of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, <span>&#x201C;Cursed</span> <i>is</i> <span>everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God <i>is</i> evident, for <span>&#x201C;the just shall live by faith.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Yet the law is not of faith, but <span>&#x201C;the man who does them shall live by them.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, <span>&#x201C;Cursed</span> <i>is</i> <span>everyone who hangs on a tree&#x201D;</span>),</span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though <i>it is</i> only a man&#x2019;s covenant, yet <i>if it is</i> confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, &#x201C;And to seeds,&#x201D; as of many, but as of one, <span>&#x201C;And to your Seed,&#x201D;</span> who is Christ. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>And this I say, <i>that</i> the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For if the inheritance <i>is</i> of the law, <i>it is</i> no longer of promise; but God gave <i>it</i> to Abraham by promise.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>What purpose then <i>does</i> the law <i>serve?</i> It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; <i>and it was</i> appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Now a mediator does not <i>mediate</i> for one <i>only,</i> but God is one.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup><i>Is</i> the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the law was our tutor <i>to bring us</i> to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>And if you <i>are</i> Christ&#x2019;s, then you are Abraham&#x2019;s seed, and heirs according to the promise.</span></p><p><span><span>4&#xA0;</span>Now I say <i>that</i> the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all, </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, &#x201C;Abba, Father!&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>But now after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how <i>is it that</i> you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage? </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>You observe days and months and seasons and years. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I <i>became</i> like you. You have not injured me at all. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, <i>even</i> as Christ Jesus. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>What then was the blessing you <i>enjoyed?</i> For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>They zealously court you, <i>but</i> for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you, </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But he <i>who was</i> of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>For it is written:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x201C;Rejoice, O barren,</span></span><br><span><i>You</i> <span>who do not bear!</span></span><br><span><span>Break forth and shout,</span></span><br><span><span>You who are not in labor!</span></span><br><span><span>For the desolate has many more children</span></span><br><span><span>Than she who has a husband.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Now we, brethren, as Isaac <i>was,</i> are children of promise. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him <i>who was born</i> according to the Spirit, even so <i>it is</i> now. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? <span>&#x201C;Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.</span></p>'

So far, in his letter to the Galatians, Paul has defended his gospel of justification by faith by appealing to the agreement reached with the apostles in Jerusalem (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 2:1–10">Gal. 2:1–10</a>) and to the personal experience of the Galatians themselves (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 3:1–5">Gal. 3:1–5</a>). Beginning in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:6">Galatians 3:6</a>, Paul now turns to the testimony of Scripture for the final and ultimate confirmation of his gospel. In fact, <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:6–4:31">Galatians 3:6–4:31</a> is made up of progressive arguments rooted in Scripture.

`What does Paul mean when he writes about the “Scripture” in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:6–8">Galatians 3:6–8</a>? Consider <a class="verse" verse="Rom 1:2; Rom 4:3; Rom 9:17">Rom. 1:2; Rom. 4:3; Rom. 9:17</a>; .`

It is important to remember that at the time Paul wrote his letter to the Galatians there was no “New Testament.” Paul was the earliest New Testament writer. The Gospel of Mark is probably the earliest of the four gospels, but it likely was not written until around the time of Paul’s death (a.d. 65)—that is, about fifteen years after Paul’s letter to the Galatians. So, when Paul refers to the scriptures, he has only the Old Testament in mind.

The Old Testament scriptures play a significant role in Paul’s teachings. He does not view them as dead texts but as the authoritative and living Word of God. In <a class="verse" verse="2 Timothy 3:16">2 Timothy 3:16</a> he writes, “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God.” The word translated “inspiration” is theopneustos. The first part of the word (theo) means “God,” while the second half means “breathed.” Scripture, therefore, is “God-breathed.” Paul, then, uses the scriptures to demonstrate that Jesus is the promised Messiah (<a class="verse" verse="Rom 1:2">Rom. 1:2</a>), to give instruction in Christian living (<a class="verse" verse="Rom 13:8–10">Rom. 13:8–10</a>), and to prove the validity of his teachings (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 3:8, 9">Gal. 3:8, 9</a>).

It is difficult to determine exactly how many hundreds of times Paul quotes the Old Testament, but quotes are found throughout all his letters, except his shortest ones, Titus and Philemon.

`Read carefully <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:6–14">Galatians 3:6–14</a>. Identify the passages from the Old Testament that Paul quotes from in these verses. What do his quotes tell us about how authoritative the Old Testament was?`

`Do you at times find yourself thinking that one part of the Bible is more “inspired” than other parts? Given Paul’s statement in <a class="verse" verse="2 Timothy 3:16">2 Timothy 3:16</a>, what’s the danger of going down that path?`
