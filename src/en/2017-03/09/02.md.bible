            '2 Cor 2; 2 Cor 5:20; 2 Cor 8:4; 2 Cor 10:2': '<h3> <span>2 Corinthians 2</span></h3><p><span><span>2&#xA0;</span>But I determined this within myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me?</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And I wrote this very thing to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow over those from whom I ought to have joy, having confidence in you all that my joy is <i>the joy</i> of you all. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but all of you to some extent&#x2014;not to be too severe. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>This punishment which <i>was inflicted</i> by the majority <i>is</i> sufficient for such a man, </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>so that, on the contrary, you <i>ought</i> rather to forgive and comfort <i>him</i>, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I urge you to reaffirm <i>your</i> love to him. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>For to this end I also wrote, that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Now whom you forgive anything, I also <i>forgive</i>. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ, </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to <i>preach</i> Christ&#x2019;s gospel, and a door was opened to me by the Lord, </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Now thanks <i>be</i> to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>To the one <i>we are</i> the aroma of death <i>leading</i> to death, and to the other the aroma of life <i>leading</i> to life. And who <i>is</i> sufficient for these things? </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>For we are not, as so many, peddling the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ.</span></p><h3> <span>2 Corinthians 5:20</span></h3><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore <i>you</i> on Christ&#x2019;s behalf, be reconciled to God. </span> </p><h3> <span>2 Corinthians 8:4</span></h3><p> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>imploring us with much urgency that we would receive the gift and the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. </span> </p><h3> <span>2 Corinthians 10:2</span></h3><p> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>But I beg you that when I am present I may not be bold with that confidence by which I intend to be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. </span> </p>'

You have not injured me at all. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, <i>even</i> as Christ Jesus. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>What then was the blessing you <i>enjoyed?</i> For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>They zealously court you, <i>but</i> for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you, </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.</span></p>'

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:12–20">Galatians 4:12–20</a>. What is the thrust of Paul’s message in these verses?`

The initial indication of the concern that weighs heavily on Paul’s heart is his personal appeal in verse 12. The appeal follows immediately after Paul’s insistence that the Galatians “become as I am.” The significance of the word entreat or beseech is, unfortunately, not fully conveyed in some translations. The word in Greek is deomai. Although it can be translated “to urge” (NKJV) or “to entreat” (ESV), the Greek word has a stronger sense of desperation connected to it (see <a class="verse" verse="2 Cor 2; 2 Cor 5:20; 2 Cor 8:4; 2 Cor 10:2">2 Cor. 2; 2 Cor. 5:20; 2 Cor. 8:4; 2 Cor. 10:2</a>; ). Paul is really saying, “I’m begging you!”

Paul’s concern, therefore, was not simply about theological ideas and doctrinal points of view. His heart was bound up with the lives of the people who were brought to Christ through his ministry. He considered himself more than just a friend; he was their spiritual father, and they were his children. But even more than that, Paul likens his concern for the Galatians to the worry and anguish that accompany a mother in childbirth (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:19">Gal. 4:19</a>). Paul had thought that his previous “labor” had been sufficient for their “safe delivery” when he founded the church. But now that the Galatians had wandered from the truth, Paul was experiencing those labor pains all over again in order to secure their well-being.

`What goal did Paul have in mind for the Galatians? What result did he want to see from all his “labor” in their behalf? <a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:19">Gal. 4:19</a>.`

Having first described the Galatians as being formed in the womb, Paul now speaks of the Galatians as if they were expectant mothers themselves. The word translated as “formed” is used medically to refer to the development of an embryo. Through this metaphor Paul describes what it means to be Christian, both individually and collectively as a church. To be a follower of Christ is more than just the profession of faith; it involves a radical transformation into the likeness of Christ. Paul was “not looking for a few minor alterations in the Galatians but for such a transformation that to see them would be to see Christ.”—Leon Morris, Galatians (Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1996), p. 142.

`In what ways have you seen the character of Christ manifested in your life? In what areas do you still have a lot of growing to do?`
