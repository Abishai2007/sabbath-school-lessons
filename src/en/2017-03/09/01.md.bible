            'Galatians 4:12–20': '<h3> <span>Galatians 4:12-20</span></h3><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I <i>became</i> like you. You have not injured me at all. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, <i>even</i> as Christ Jesus. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>What then was the blessing you <i>enjoyed?</i> For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>They zealously court you, <i>but</i> for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you, </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.</span></p>'
            '1 Cor 9:19–23': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 9:19-23</span></h3><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For though I am free from all <i>men,</i> I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win the more; </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those <i>who are</i> under the law, as under the law, that I might win those <i>who are</i> under the law; </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>to those <i>who are</i> without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those <i>who are</i> without law; </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>to the weak I became as weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all <i>men,</i> that I might by all means save some. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Now this I do for the gospel&#x2019;s sake, that I may be partaker of it with <i>you.</i></span></p>'
            'Galatians 4:12': '<h3> <span>Galatians 4:12</span></h3><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I <i>became</i> like you. You have not injured me at all. </span> </p>'
            '2 Cor 4:7–12': '<h3> <span>2 Corinthians 4:7-12</span></h3><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup><i>We are</i> hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; <i>we are</i> perplexed, but not in despair; </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus&#x2019; sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>So then death is working in us, but life in you.</span></p>'
            'Gal 4:12–20': '<h3> <span>Galatians 4:12-20</span></h3><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I <i>became</i> like you.

            '1 Cor 11:1': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 11:1</span></h3><p><span><span>11&#xA0;</span>Imitate me, just as I also <i>imitate</i> Christ.</span></p>'

> “Friends, I beg you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are” (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:12">Galatians 4:12</a>, NRSV).

As we’ve seen so far, Paul did not mince words with the Galatians. His strong language, however, simply reflected the inspired passion he felt concerning the spiritual welfare of the church that he had founded. Besides the crucial theological issue Paul was dealing with, the letter to the Galatians in a broad sense also shows just how important correct doctrine is. If what we believed were not that important, if doctrinal correctness did not matter all that much, then why would Paul have been so fervent, so uncompromising, in his letter? The truth is, of course, that what we believe matters greatly, especially concerning the whole question of the gospel.

In <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:12–20">Galatians 4:12–20</a> Paul continues his discourse, though he changes his approach, at least a bit. Paul has made a number of detailed and theologically sophisticated arguments to persuade the Galatians of their errors, and now he makes a more personal, pastoral appeal. Unlike the false teachers who had no true interest in the Galatians, Paul reveals the genuine concern, hope, and love of a good shepherd for his wayward flock. He was not just correcting theology; he was seeking to minister to those whom he loved.
