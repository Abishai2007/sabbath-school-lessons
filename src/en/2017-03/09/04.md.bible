            '1 Corinthians 9:19–23': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 9:19-23</span></h3><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For though I am free from all <i>men,</i> I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win the more; </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those <i>who are</i> under the law, as under the law, that I might win those <i>who are</i> under the law; </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>to those <i>who are</i> without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those <i>who are</i> without law; </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>to the weak I became as weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all <i>men,</i> that I might by all means save some. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Now this I do for the gospel&#x2019;s sake, that I may be partaker of it with <i>you.</i></span></p>'
            '1 Corinthians 9:21': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 9:21</span></h3><p> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>to those <i>who are</i> without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those <i>who are</i> without law; </span> </p>'
            'Galatians 4:12': '<h3> <span>Galatians 4:12</span></h3><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I <i>became</i> like you. You have not injured me at all. </span> </p>'
            'Acts 17:16–34': '<h3> <span>Acts 17:16-34</span></h3><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was given over to idols. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and with the <i>Gentile</i> worshipers, and in the marketplace daily with those who happened to be there. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Then certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, &#x201C;What does this babbler want to say?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Others said, &#x201C;He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods,&#x201D; because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, &#x201C;May we know what this new doctrine <i>is</i> of which you speak? </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>For you are bringing some strange things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>For all the Athenians and the foreigners who were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, &#x201C;Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious; </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription:</span></p><p><span>TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you: </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Nor is He worshiped with men&#x2019;s hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives to all life, breath, and all things. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, &#x2018;For we are also His offspring.&#x2019; </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, something shaped by art and man&#x2019;s devising. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent, </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, while others said, &#x201C;We will hear you again on this <i>matter.</i>&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>So Paul departed from among them. </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>However, some men joined him and believed, among them Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span></p>'
            '1 Cor 8:8–13': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 8:8-13</span></h3><p> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But food does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol&#x2019;s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things offered to idols? </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And because of your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>But when you thus sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.</span></p>'
            'Gal 2:11–14': '<h3> <span>Galatians 2:11-14</span></h3><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed; </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>for before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before <i>them</i> all, &#x201C;If you, being a Jew, live in the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews, why do you compel Gentiles to live as Jews? </span> </p>'

`Read <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 9:19–23">1 Corinthians 9:19–23</a>. What does Paul say in these verses that can help us understand better his point in the latter part of <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:12">Galatians 4:12</a>? See also <a class="verse" verse="Acts 17:16–34">Acts 17:16–34</a>, <a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 8:8–13">1 Cor. 8:8–13</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Gal 2:11–14">Gal. 2:11–14</a>.`

<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:12">Galatians 4:12</a> can seem a little confusing. Why should the Galatians become like Paul, if he already had become like them?

As we saw in yesterday’s study, Paul wanted the Galatians to become like him in his complete faith and confidence in the all-sufficiency of Christ for salvation. His comment about having become like them was a reminder of how, although he was a Jew, he had become a Gentile “without the law” so that he might reach the Gentiles among them with the gospel. As the great missionary to the Gentile world, Paul had learned how to preach the gospel to both Jews and Gentiles. In fact, according to <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 9:19–23">1 Corinthians 9:19–23</a>, though the gospel remained the same, Paul’s method varied depending on the people he was trying to reach.

“Paul was a pioneer in what we call today contextualization, the need to communicate the gospel in such a way that it speaks to the total context of the people to whom it is addressed.”—Timothy George, The New American Commentary: Galatians (Nashville, Tenn.: Broadman & Holman Publishers, 1994), p. 321.

Paul’s own comments in <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 9:21">1 Corinthians 9:21</a> indicate that he believed there were limits to how far someone should go in contextualizing the gospel. He mentions, for example, that while one is free to reach out in different ways to Jews and Gentiles, this freedom does not include the right to live a lawless lifestyle, for Christians are under the “law of Christ.”

Although contextualization is not always easy, “insofar as we are able to separate the heart of the gospel from its cultural cocoon, to contextualize the message of Christ without compromising its content, we too should become imitators of Paul.”—Timothy George, Galatians, pp. 321, 322.

`It’s so easy to compromise, isn’t it? Sometimes the longer one is a Christian, the easier compromise gets, too.Why might that be so? Look at yourself, honestly. How much compromise has crept into your life, and what have been the ways you have justified it? How can you turn this around in areas in which you need to do so?`
