            '1 Corinthians 9:19–23': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 9:19-23</span></h3><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For though I am free from all <i>men,</i> I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win the more; </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those <i>who are</i> under the law, as under the law, that I might win those <i>who are</i> under the law; </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>to those <i>who are</i> without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those <i>who are</i> without law; </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>to the weak I became as weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all <i>men,</i> that I might by all means save some. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Now this I do for the gospel&#x2019;s sake, that I may be partaker of it with <i>you.</i></span></p>'
            '2 Corinthians 1': '<h3> <span>2 Corinthians 1</span></h3><p><span><span>1&#xA0;</span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy <i>our</i> brother,</span></p><p><span>To the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Blessed <i>be</i> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds through Christ. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Now if we are afflicted, <i>it is</i> for your consolation and salvation, which is effective for enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer. Or if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And our hope for you <i>is</i> steadfast, because we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also <i>you will partake</i> of the consolation.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our trouble which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Yes, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead, </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver us; in whom we trust that He will still deliver <i>us,</i> </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>you also helping together in prayer for us, that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the gift <i>granted</i> to us through many.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God, and more abundantly toward you. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>For we are not writing any other things to you than what you read or understand. Now I trust you will understand, even to the end </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>(as also you have understood us in part), that we are your boast as you also <i>are</i> ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And in this confidence I intended to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>to pass by way of you to Macedonia, to come again from Macedonia to you, and be helped by you on my way to Judea. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, when I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or the things I plan, do I plan according to the flesh, that with me there should be Yes, Yes, and No, No? </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But <i>as</i> God <i>is</i> faithful, our word to you was not Yes and No. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us&#x2014;by me, Silvanus, and Timothy&#x2014;was not Yes and No, but in Him was Yes. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>For all the promises of God in Him <i>are</i> Yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God through us. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us <i>is</i> God, </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>who also has sealed us and given us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Moreover I call God as witness against my soul, that to spare you I came no more to Corinth. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are fellow workers for your joy; for by faith you stand.</span></p>'

            'Acts 14:1–26': '<h3> <span>Acts 14:1-26</span></h3><p><span><span>14&#xA0;</span>Now it happened in Iconium that they went together to the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who was bearing witness to the word of His grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>But the multitude of the city was divided: part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And when a violent attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to abuse and stone them, </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>they became aware of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding region. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And they were preaching the gospel there.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And in Lystra a certain man without strength in his feet was sitting, a cripple from his mother&#x2019;s womb, who had never walked. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup><i>This</i> man heard Paul speaking. Paul, observing him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed, </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>said with a loud voice, &#x201C;Stand up straight on your feet!&#x201D; And he leaped and walked. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Now when the people saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in the Lycaonian <i>language,</i> &#x201C;The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, intending to sacrifice with the multitudes.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard this, they tore their clothes and ran in among the multitude, crying out </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>and saying, &#x201C;Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men with the same nature as you, and preach to you that you should turn from these useless things to the living God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all things that are in them, </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>who in bygone generations allowed all nations to walk in their own ways. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good, gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>And with these sayings they could scarcely restrain the multitudes from sacrificing to them.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Then Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there; and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul <i>and</i> dragged <i>him</i> out of the city, supposing him to be dead. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>However, when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and went into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And when they had preached the gospel to that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting <i>them</i> to continue in the faith, and <i>saying,</i> &#x201C;We must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>So when they had appointed elders in every church, and prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And after they had passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Now when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had completed.</span></p>'
            'Luke 15:1–10': '<h3> <span>Luke 15:1-10</span></h3><p><span><span>15&#xA0;</span>Then all the tax collectors and the sinners drew near to Him to hear Him. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And the Pharisees and scribes complained, saying, &#x201C;This Man receives sinners and eats with them.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>So He spoke this parable to them, saying:</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?</span> </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup><span>And when he has found <i>it,</i> he lays <i>it</i> on his shoulders, rejoicing.</span> </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup><span>And when he comes home, he calls together <i>his</i> friends and neighbors, saying to them, &#x2018;Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup><span>I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.</span></span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;Or what woman, having ten silver coins,</span><span> if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds <i>it?</i></span> </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup><span>And when she has found <i>it,</i> she calls <i>her</i> friends and neighbors together, saying, &#x2018;Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I lost!&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup><span>Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.&#x201D;</span></span></p>'

            '2 Cor 2:4': '<h3> <span>2 Corinthians 2:4</span></h3><p> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you.</span></p>'
            'Col 1:27': '<h3> <span>Colossians 1:27</span></h3><p> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>To them God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles: which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. </span> </p>'
            'Gal 2:20': '<h3> <span>Galatians 2:20</span></h3><p> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the <i>life</i> which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. </span> </p>'

            'John 3': '<h3> <span>John 3</span></h3><p><span><span>3&#xA0;</span>There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, &#x201C;Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, <span>&#x201C;Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Nicodemus said to Him, &#x201C;How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother&#x2019;s womb and be born?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Jesus answered, <span>&#x201C;Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</span> </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup><span>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup><span>Do not marvel that I said to you, &#x2018;You must be born again.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup><span>The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Nicodemus answered and said to Him, &#x201C;How can these things be?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, <span>&#x201C;Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?</span> </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup><span>Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak what We know and testify what We have seen, and you do not receive Our witness.</span> </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup><span>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</span> </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup><span>No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, <i>that is,</i> the Son of Man who is in heaven.</span> </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup><span>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</span> </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup><span>that whoever believes in Him should not perish but</span> <span>have eternal life.</span> </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup><span>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.</span> </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup><span>For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.</span></span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span> </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup><span>And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</span> </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup><span>For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.</span> </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup><span>But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He remained with them and baptized. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Now John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>For John had not yet been thrown into prison.</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Then there arose a dispute between <i>some</i> of John&#x2019;s disciples and the Jews about purification. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And they came to John and said to him, &#x201C;Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified&#x2014;behold, He is baptizing, and all are coming to Him!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>John answered and said, &#x201C;A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, &#x2018;I am not the Christ,&#x2019; but, &#x2018;I have been sent before Him.&#x2019; </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom&#x2019;s voice. Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>He must increase, but I <i>must</i> decrease. </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And what He has seen and heard, that He testifies; and no one receives His testimony. </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>He who has received His testimony has certified that God is true. </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure. </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand. </span> <span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.&#x201D;</span></p>'

### The Lesson in Brief

**Key Text**: <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:12">Galatians 4:12</a>

#### The Student Will:

- **Know**: Describe how Paul’s letter to the Galatians moved from scriptural argument to one based on personal appeal.
- **Feel**: Appreciate the emotional plea that Paul made as a pastor, sharing his anxieties and reminding the Galatians of their shared experiences.
- **Do**: Resolve to benefit not only from our leaders’ spiritual insights but also from their human love and concern, and support them in turn.

#### Learning Outline:

1. Know: Double Appeal
+ Why did Paul make both a theological and a personal appeal?
+ Why would sharing his ministerial anxieties help the Galatians realize the seriousness of their crisis?

2. Feel: Pastoral Anxiety
+ How did relating their shared history help Paul evoke earlier memories of important lessons?
+ Why might Paul’s arguing, pleading, and agonizing awaken a heartfelt revival of relationship, as well as an intellectual assent to truth?
+ How did Paul contrast his passionate concern for the church’s wellbeing with the false teachers’ desires to court favor?

3. Do: Loving, Though Uncomfortable, Truth
+ How can we be open to lessons that chide and upbraid us, as well as those that encourage and uplift us?
+ How can we, like Paul, use relationships as platforms for sharing truth, even when it is uncomfortable?
+ How can we support those who might have gone through spiritual “childbirth” on our behalf?

**Summary**: After strong spiritual argument, Paul made an emotional appeal to the Galatians to remain in the gospel of grace.

#### Learning Cycle

##### STEP 1—Motivate

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: The gospel we preach should be the gospel we live. There is nothing quite as irresistible as a Christian thoroughly in love with Jesus Christ and committed to the salvation of lost human beings.

**Just for Teachers**: Discuss the social reality in which much of the world finds itself today, a reality in which words and deeds rarely come together to give a clear picture of who people really are.

Talkers abound. One need only turn on the radio, watch the television, or surf the Internet to discover a retinue of talking heads who are only too happy to opine about the latest hot-button issue. Financial analysts feel qualified to decry the state of the education system. Politicians say one thing when seeking election, then do the opposite once in office, all the while accepting thinly veiled bribes from special interests.

And then there are those who on national airwaves spew up words and antics calculated to breed hatred. The world seems to be awash in a torrent of meaningless blather—people totally out of their depth who nevertheless continue on undaunted.

Like a military commander depositing stealth fighters behind enemy lines, God drops the Christian into the din of empty talk to live and speak the gospel. What amazing love for a fallen world.

**Consider This**: Ask the class to come up with a list of the “big talkers” who dominate the media. What is it that keeps them in the news? Why do they have an audience? Are their core messages positive or negative? Finally, do they live what they spew?


#### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: As you explore this week’s commentary, the class will take a close look at Paul’s personal obedience to God, his willingness to sacrifice to see Christ formed in believers, and his emotional efforts to get them to choose Christ. Paul’s heart for the lost is positively inspiring.

**Bible Commentary**

**I. Reaching the Heart Through a Living Faith** (Read <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 9:19–23">1 Corinthians 9:19–23</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Acts 14:1–26">Acts 14:1–26</a>, and <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:12">Galatians 4:12</a> with your class.)

Tuesday’s study treats us to an exploration of one of the most important aspects of sharing truth: truth that is contextualized for the people with whom it is shared has the best chance of reaching the heart. Paul’s understanding of this reality led him to “become all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 9:22">1 Cor. 9:22</a>, NIV).

In spite of his noble desire to lead others to Jesus, Paul does not approach his task carelessly, especially as it relates to his understanding of God’s law and civic legal codes. There is a reason for Paul’s strict adherence to a personal code of conduct that is above reproach. While Paul and Barnabas were ministering in Iconium—with great success—“the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren” (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 14:2">Acts 14:2</a>, NKJV). The multitude of the city became so divided that “part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles” (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 14:4">Acts 14:4</a>, NKJV).

The apostle Paul could not afford to be reckless in the way he lived his faith. For one, his enemies kept close tabs on him; but more than that, Paul’s desire was to please God first and foremost.

**Consider This**: Ask someone in the class to read <a class="verse" verse="Luke 15:1–10">Luke 15:1–10</a>. Note the fact that Jesus faced spurious attacks when attempting to do good to those on the margins of society during His day. Ask: In what ways did Paul’s contextualization of the gospel mirror Christ’s? In what ways did it differ?

**II. Whatever It Takes** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:19">Galatians 4:19</a>, <a class="verse" verse="John 3:3">John 3:3</a>, and <a class="verse" verse="Colossians 1:27">Colossians 1:27</a> with your class.)

Paul used the metaphor of childbirth to make the point that he had endured, as it were, the pangs of childbirth in order to bring these people to Christ. But as they contemplated returning to a legalistic form of the faith, the process of “birthing” them would have to begin again. Paul is no doubt echoing the language of Jesus as He spoke to Nicodemus (see <a class="verse" verse="John 3">John 3</a>).

The apostle persisted in the Galatian outreach because he wanted Christ to be fully formed in them and reign in their hearts (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 2:20">Gal. 2:20</a>). As Wednesday’s study makes clear, Paul presses through personal illness to complete his task. In his letter to the Colossians, he again uses the language and metaphor of maternity to make clear that Christ’s being formed in us represents humanity’s only “hope of glory” (<a class="verse" verse="Col 1:27">Col. 1:27</a>).

**Consider This**: Explore the concept of spiritual growth with your class. What does the life of a Christian look like once Christ begins to be formed within? What changes? What stays the same? Why was Paul so motivated to help the Galatian believers come to a deep and abiding faith in Jesus Christ as their only Source of salvation? What did Paul’s life look like after Christ was “birthed” in his heart? How might this change in his own life, and the corresponding freedom it brought, have been the driving force behind Paul’s desire to see others experience the same?

**III. Closing the Deal** (Read <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:16">Galatians 4:16</a> and <a class="verse" verse="2 Corinthians 1">2 Corinthians 1</a> and 2 with your class.)

Emotional appeals are one of the truly distinguishing characteristics of the apostle Paul. At a time when many ministers of the gospel shy away from making sermonic appeals, Paul’s “naked” appeals seem out of step. To be sure, emotions can be played like an instrument, and many religious leaders have mastered the trade, but Paul is not being insincere.

In <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:16">Galatians 4:16</a>, Paul, a close friend of the Galatian believers, risked that friendship in an effort to help them “see” Christ through the haze of legalism that had enveloped them. “Are you angry at me because I tell you the truth?” he’d say in today’s parlance.

Paul’s appeal to the Corinthian church in <a class="verse" verse="2 Corinthians 1">2 Corinthians 1</a> and 2 is even more disquieting. His ministerial authority challenged, Paul wrote: “For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Cor 2:4">2 Cor. 2:4</a>, NKJV).

Paul’s love for those he wanted to come to know Christ underpinned his appeals and made them effective.

**Consider This**: Why are some Christians afraid to put their “hearts” on the line as they reach out to others? Some cultures are more reserved than others. What role should cultural norms play in the way we appeal to men and women on behalf of Christ?

##### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Encourage your students to answer the personal inventory questions below. Allow time for those who may wish to share their responses.

**Thought Questions**:

1. How did you come to accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior? Was it through the encouragement of a friend, a great sermon that convicted your heart, or an appeal that you simply could not resist? What “hooked” you and made you want to give your life to Jesus?
2. Paul often faced rejection in his efforts to win souls to Christ. Does the fear of rejection stop you from sharing your faith? How do you plan to overcome it?

**Application Question**:

1. Second Corinthians 5:20 states: “Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ’s behalf, be reconciled to God” (NKJV). What specific gifts or talents do you possess that God can use to plead for others through you?

**Questions for Witnessing**:

1. It is obvious that a chorus of contradictory voices was confusing the Galatian believers. If not, Paul would not have gone to such great pains to explain the law and the ways in which it complements faith in Jesus Christ. What unique challenges does the “chattering class” of our day present for the Christian attempting to share God’s gospel?
2. How do we strike the correct balance between building relationships with those we wish to see saved and telling them the truth? What role does the Holy Spirit play in the process?

##### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: Distribute slips of paper to the class, and ask them to write one or two sentences detailing how we should appeal to the people mentioned in the following scenarios:

1. An often-inebriated man wanders by your church each Sabbath because he knows that he’s sure to get a hot meal, and some members will give him money. He never comes to church for any of the services. How should the church respond?
2. Sarah has visited your church several times. She is attentive during the services and has even purchased a Bible for the first time so that she can follow along with the minister. Everyone wonders when she’ll give her heart to Jesus and become baptized, but your minister rarely makes appeals.When he does, he seems uncomfortable and rushes to end it. How would you go about appealing to Sarah?
3. A close friend of yours has been cheating on her taxes for years. She looks for all the loopholes to save money, but she also goes over the line. She sometimes jokes about it with you and justifies her behavior by saying, “It’s my money anyway. All the government does is waste it.” How would you go about helping her to see that this behavior is wrong? Would you bring God into the mix, or just address her from the legal perspective—that she is breaking the law? Explain.
