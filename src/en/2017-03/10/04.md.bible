            'Gen 17:15–19; 18:10–13': '<h3> <span>Genesis 17:15-19</span></h3><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Then God said to Abraham, &#x201C;As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah <i>shall be</i> her name. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And I will bless her and also give you a son by her; then I will bless her, and she shall be <i>a mother of</i> nations; kings of peoples shall be from her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, &#x201C;Shall <i>a child</i> be born to a man who is one hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear <i>a child?</i>&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>And Abraham said to God, &#x201C;Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Then God said: &#x201C;No, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, <i>and</i> with his descendants after him. </span> </p><h3> <span>Genesis 18:10-13</span></h3><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>And He said, &#x201C;I will certainly return to you according to the time of life, and behold, Sarah your wife shall have a son.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>(Sarah was listening in the tent door which <i>was</i> behind him.) </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age; <i>and</i> Sarah had passed the age of childbearing. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, &#x201C;After I have grown old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Abraham, &#x201C;Why did Sarah laugh, saying, &#x2018;Shall I surely bear <i>a child,</i> since I am old?&#x2019; </span> </p>'
            'Genesis 17:18, 19': '<h3> <span>Genesis 17:18</span></h3><p> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>And Abraham said to God, &#x201C;Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!&#x201D;</span></p><h3> <span>Genesis 17:19</span></h3><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Then God said: &#x201C;No, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, <i>and</i> with his descendants after him. </span> </p>'
            'Heb 11:11, 12': '<h3> <span>Hebrews 11:11</span></h3><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>By faith Sarah herself also received strength to conceive seed, and she bore a child when she was past the age, because she judged Him faithful who had promised. </span> </p><h3> <span>Hebrews 11:12</span></h3><p> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born <i>as many</i> as the stars of the sky in multitude&#x2014;innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.</span></p>'
            'Gen 12:11–16': '<h3> <span>Genesis 12:11-16</span></h3><p> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And it came to pass, when he was close to entering Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, &#x201C;Indeed I know that you <i>are</i> a woman of beautiful countenance. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore it will happen, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, &#x2018;This <i>is</i> his wife&#x2019;; and they will kill me, but they will let you live. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Please say you <i>are</i> my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that I may live because of you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>So it was, when Abram came into Egypt, that the Egyptians saw the woman, that she <i>was</i> very beautiful. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>The princes of Pharaoh also saw her and commended her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken to Pharaoh&#x2019;s house. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>He treated Abram well for her sake. He had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male and female servants, female donkeys, and camels.</span></p>'
            'Gal 4:21–31': '<h3> <span>Galatians 4:21-31</span></h3><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But he <i>who was</i> of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>For it is written:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x201C;Rejoice, O barren,</span></span><br><span><i>You</i> <span>who do not bear!</span></span><br><span><span>Break forth and shout,</span></span><br><span><span>You who are not in labor!</span></span><br><span><span>For the desolate has many more children</span></span><br><span><span>Than she who has a husband.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Now we, brethren, as Isaac <i>was,</i> are children of promise. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him <i>who was born</i> according to the Spirit, even so <i>it is</i> now. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? <span>&#x201C;Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.</span></p>'
            'Genesis 16': '<h3> <span>Genesis 16</span></h3><p><span><span>16&#xA0;</span>Now Sarai, Abram&#x2019;s wife, had borne him no <i>children.</i> And she had an Egyptian maidservant whose name was Hagar. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>So Sarai said to Abram, &#x201C;See now, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has restrained me from bearing <i>children.</i> Please, go in to my maid; perhaps I shall obtain children by her.&#x201D; And Abram heeded the voice of Sarai. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then Sarai, Abram&#x2019;s wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>So he went in to Hagar, and she conceived.

`Why does Paul have such a disparaging view of the incident with Hagar? <a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:21–31">Gal. 4:21–31</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 16">Genesis 16</a>. What crucial point about salvation is Paul making through his use of this Old Testament story?`

Hagar’s place in the Genesis story directly is related to Abram’s failure to believe God’s promise. As an Egyptian slave in Abram’s household, Hagar likely came into Abram’s possession as one of the many gifts Pharaoh gave to him in exchange for Sarai, an event associated with Abram’s first act of unbelief in God’s promise (<a class="verse" verse="Gen 12:11–16">Gen. 12:11–16</a>).

After waiting ten years for the promised child to be born, Abram and Sarai remained childless. Concluding that God needed their “help,” Sarai gave Hagar to Abram as a concubine. Although strange to us today, Sarai’s plan was quite ingenious. According to ancient customs, a female slave legally could serve as a surrogate mother for her barren mistress. Thus, Sarai could count any child born from her husband and Hagar as her own. While the plan did produce a child, it was not the child God promised.

In this story we have a powerful example of how when faced with daunting circumstances, even a great man of God had a lapse of faith. In <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 17:18, 19">Genesis 17:18, 19</a>, Abraham pleaded with God to accept Ishmael as his heir; the Lord, of course, rejected that offer. The only “miraculous” element in the birth of Ishmael was Sarah’s willingness to share her husband with another woman! There was nothing out of the ordinary about the birth of a child to this woman, a child born “according to the flesh.” Had Abraham trusted in what God had promised him instead of letting the circumstances overcome that trust, none of this would have happened, and a lot of grief would have been avoided.

`In contrast to the birth of Ishmael, look at the circumstances surrounding Isaac’s birth. <a class="verse" verse="Gen 17:15–19; 18:10–13">Gen. 17:15–19; 18:10–13</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Heb 11:11, 12">Heb. 11:11, 12</a>. Why did these circumstances require so much faith of Abraham and Sarah?`

`In what ways has your lack of faith in God’s promises caused you some pain? How can you learn from these mistakes to take God at His word, no matter what? What choices can you make that can help strengthen your ability to trust God’s promises?`
