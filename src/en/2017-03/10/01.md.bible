            'Gen 1:28; 2:2, 3; 3:15; 15:1–6': '<h3> <span>Genesis 1:28</span></h3><p> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Then God blessed them, and God said to them, &#x201C;Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.&#x201D;</span></p><h3> <span>Genesis 2:2</span></h3><p> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. </span> </p><h3> <span>Genesis 2:3</span></h3><p> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.</span></p><h3> <span>Genesis 3:15</span></h3><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And I will put enmity</span><br><span>Between you and the woman,</span><br><span>And between your seed and her Seed;</span><br><span>He shall bruise your head,</span><br><span>And you shall bruise His heel.&#x201D;</span></p><h3> <span>Genesis 15:1-6</span></h3><p><span><span>15&#xA0;</span>After these things the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> came to Abram in a vision, saying, &#x201C;Do not be afraid, Abram. I <i>am</i> your shield, your exceedingly great reward.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>But Abram said, &#x201C;Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span>, what will You give me, seeing I go childless, and the heir of my house <i>is</i> Eliezer of Damascus?&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then Abram said, &#x201C;Look, You have given me no offspring; indeed one born in my house is my heir!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And behold, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> <i>came</i> to him, saying, &#x201C;This one shall not be your heir, but one who will come from your own body shall be your heir.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Then He brought him outside and said, &#x201C;Look now toward heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them.&#x201D; And He said to him, &#x201C;So shall your descendants be.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And he believed in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and He accounted it to him for righteousness.</span></p>'
            'Exod 6:2–8; 19:3–6': '<h3> <span>Exodus 6:2-8</span></h3><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And God spoke to Moses and said to him: &#x201C;I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but <i>by</i> My name <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> I was not known to them. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>I have also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were strangers. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered My covenant. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Therefore say to the children of Israel: &#x2018;I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>; I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, I will rescue you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>I will take you as My people, and I will be your God. Then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to you <i>as</i> a heritage: I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.&#x2019;&#x201D; </span> </p><h3> <span>Exodus 19:3-6</span></h3><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And Moses went up to God, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> called to him from the mountain, saying, &#x201C;Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>&#x2018;You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and <i>how</i> I bore you on eagles&#x2019; wings and brought you to Myself. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth <i>is</i> Mine. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#x2019; These <i>are</i> the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.&#x201D;</span></p>'

            'Gal 4:21–31': '<h3> <span>Galatians 4:21-31</span></h3><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But he <i>who was</i> of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>For it is written:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x201C;Rejoice, O barren,</span></span><br><span><i>You</i> <span>who do not bear!</span></span><br><span><span>Break forth and shout,</span></span><br><span><span>You who are not in labor!</span></span><br><span><span>For the desolate has many more children</span></span><br><span><span>Than she who has a husband.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Now we, brethren, as Isaac <i>was,</i> are children of promise. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him <i>who was born</i> according to the Spirit, even so <i>it is</i> now. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? <span>&#x201C;Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.</span></p>'

> “But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother” (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:26">Galatians 4:26</a>, NIV).

Christians who reject the authority of the Old Testament often see the giving of the law on Sinai as inconsistent with the gospel. They conclude that the covenant given on Sinai represents an era, a dispensation, from a time in human history when salvation was based on obedience to the law. But because the people failed to live up to the demands of the law, God (they say) ushered in a new covenant, a covenant of grace through the merits of Jesus Christ. This, then, is their understanding of the two covenants: the old based on law, and the new based on grace.

However common that view may be, it is wrong. Salvation was never by obedience to the law. Biblical Judaism, from the start, was always a religion of grace. The legalism that Paul was confronting in Galatia was a perversion, not just of Christianity but of the Old Testament itself. The two covenants are not matters of time; instead, they are reflective of human attitudes. They represent two different ways of trying to relate to God, ways that go back to Cain and Abel. The old covenant represents those who, like Cain, mistakenly rely on their own obedience as a means of pleasing God. In contrast, the new covenant represents the experience of those who, like Abel, rely wholly upon God’s grace to do all that He has promised.
