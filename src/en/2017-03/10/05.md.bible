            'Gal 4:21–31': '<h3> <span>Galatians 4:21-31</span></h3><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But he <i>who was</i> of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>For it is written:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x201C;Rejoice, O barren,</span></span><br><span><i>You</i> <span>who do not bear!</span></span><br><span><span>Break forth and shout,</span></span><br><span><span>You who are not in labor!</span></span><br><span><span>For the desolate has many more children</span></span><br><span><span>Than she who has a husband.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Now we, brethren, as Isaac <i>was,</i> are children of promise. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him <i>who was born</i> according to the Spirit, even so <i>it is</i> now. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? <span>&#x201C;Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.</span></p>'
            'Exodus 19:5': '<h3> <span>Exodus 19:5</span></h3><p> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth <i>is</i> Mine. </span> </p>'

_<a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:21–31">Gal. 4:21–31</a>_

`What type of covenant relationship did God want to establish with His people at Sinai? What similarities does it share with God’s promise to Abraham? <a class="verse" verse="Exod 6:2–8, 19:3–6">Exod. 6:2–8, 19:3–6</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Deut 32:10–12">Deut. 32:10–12</a>.`

God desired to share the same covenant relationship with the children of Israel at Sinai that He shared with Abraham. In fact, similarities exist between God’s words to Abraham in <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 12:1–3">Genesis 12:1–3</a> and His words to Moses in <a class="verse" verse="Exodus 19">Exodus 19</a>. In both cases, God emphasizes what He will do for His people. He does not ask the Israelites to promise to do anything to earn His blessings; instead, they are to obey as a response to those blessings. The Hebrew word translated “to obey” in <a class="verse" verse="Exodus 19:5">Exodus 19:5</a> literally means “to hear.” God’s words do not imply righteousness by works. On the contrary, He wanted Israel to have the same faith that characterized Abraham’s response to His promises (at least most of the time!).

`If the covenant relationship God offered to Israel on Sinai is similar to the one given to Abraham, why does Paul identify Mount Sinai with the negative experience of Hagar? <a class="verse" verse="Exod 19:7–25">Exod. 19:7–25</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Heb 8:6, 7">Heb. 8:6, 7</a>.`

The covenant at Sinai was intended to point out the sinfulness of humanity and the remedy of God’s abundant grace, which was typified in the sanctuary services. The problem with the Sinai covenant was not on God’s part but rather on the people’s part because of their faulty promises (<a class="verse" verse="Heb 8:6">Heb. 8:6</a>). Instead of responding to God’s promises in humility and faith, the Israelites responded with self-confidence. “ ‘All that the Lord hath spoken we will do’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Exod 19:8">Exod. 19:8</a>). After living as slaves in Egypt for more than four hundred years, they had no true concept of God’s majesty nor of the extent of their own sinfulness. In the same way that Abraham and Sarah tried to help God fulfill His promises, the Israelites sought to turn God’s covenant of grace into a covenant of works. Hagar symbolizes Sinai in that both reveal human attempts at salvation by works.

Paul is not claiming that the law given at Sinai was evil or abolished. He is concerned with the Galatians’ legalistic misapprehension of the law. “Instead of serving to convict them of the absolute impossibility of pleasing God by law-keeping, the law fostered in them a deeply entrenched determination to depend on personal resources in order to please God. Thus the law did not serve the purposes of grace in leading the Judaizers to Christ. Instead, it closed them off from Christ.” —O. Palmer Robertson, The Christ of the Covenants (Phillipsburg, N.J.: Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co., 1980), p. 181.
