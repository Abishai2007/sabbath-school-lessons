            '1 Corinthians 9:19– 23;': '<h3>1 Corinthians 9:19- 23</h3><sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>For though I am free from all <i>men,</i> I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win the more; <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those <i>who are</i> under the law, as under the law, that I might win those <i>who are</i> under the law; <sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>to those <i>who are</i> without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those <i>who are</i> without law; <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>to the weak I became as weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all <i>men,</i> that I might by all means save some. <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>Now this I do for the gospel&#x2019;s sake, that I may be partaker of it with <i>you.</i>'
            '2 Corinthians 4:7–12': '<h3>2 Corinthians 4:7-12.</h3><sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. <sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup><i>We are</i> hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; <i>we are</i> perplexed, but not in despair; <sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. <sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus&#x2019; sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. <sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>So then death is working in us, but life in you.'

> “I make my appeal [request] to you, brothers and sisters. [I am] asking you to become like me. After all, I became like you” (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:12, ">Galatians 4:12, </a>NIrV).

So far, we have seen how Paul uses very strong words to deal with the Galatians. But his strong words point to how deeply he feels about the spiritual well-being of the church he started. Paul’s letter to the Galatians shows just how important the correct teachings are. Suppose for a moment that right beliefs and right actions were not important. Then why would Paul have cared so much about these things in his letter? The truth is that, yes, what we believe and what we do matter greatly. And that is especially true of the gospel.

In <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:12–20, ">Galatians 4:12–20, </a>Paul continues his discussion. But now he changes his approach to the topic. Paul has made many arguments to win over the Galatians to his way of thinking. But now he makes a more personal appeal or request. Paul is not like the false teachers who have no true interest in the Galatians. Instead, he shows true concern, worry, hope, and love for them in the way a good shepherd does for his flock. Paul is not just correcting their wrong beliefs. He is serving the people he loves.
