            '1 Corinthians 9:19–23 ': '<h3>1 Corinthians 9:19-23</h3><sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>For though I am free from all <i>men,</i> I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win the more; <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those <i>who are</i> under the law, as under the law, that I might win those <i>who are</i> under the law; <sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>to those <i>who are</i> without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those <i>who are</i> without law; <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>to the weak I became as weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all <i>men,</i> that I might by all means save some. <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>Now this I do for the gospel&#x2019;s sake, that I may be partaker of it with <i>you.</i>'
            '1 Corinthians 8:8–13; ': '<h3>1 Corinthians 8:8-13</h3><sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>But food does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse.<sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak. <sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol&#x2019;s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things offered to idols? <sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>And because of your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? <sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>But when you thus sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. <sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.'
            '1 Corinthians 9:21 ': '<h3>1 Corinthians 9:21</h3><sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>to those <i>who are</i> without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those <i>who are</i> without law; '
            'Galatians 2:11–14': '<h3>Galatians 2:11-14.</h3><sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed; <sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>for before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. <sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.<sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before <i>them</i> all, &#x201C;If you, being a Jew, live in the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews, why do you compel Gentiles to live as Jews? '
            'Galatians 4:12, ': '<h3>Galatians 4:12</h3><sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I <i>became</i> like you. You have not injured me at all. '
            'Galatians 4:12 ': '<h3>Galatians 4:12</h3><sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I <i>became</i> like you. You have not injured me at all. '
            'Galatians 4:12': '<h3>Galatians 4:12</h3><sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I <i>became</i> like you. You have not injured me at all. '
            'Acts 17:16–34;': '<h3>Acts 17:16-34</h3><sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was given over to idols. <sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and with the <i>Gentile</i> worshipers, and in the marketplace daily with those who happened to be there. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>Then certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, &#x201C;What does this babbler want to say?&#x201D;Others said, &#x201C;He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods,&#x201D; because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.<sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, &#x201C;May we know what this new doctrine <i>is</i> of which you speak? <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>For you are bringing some strange things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>For all the Athenians and the foreigners who were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.<sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, &#x201C;Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious; <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription:TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you: <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands. <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>Nor is He worshiped with men&#x2019;s hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives to all life, breath, and all things. <sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, <sup class="versenum">27&#xA0;</sup>so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; <sup class="versenum">28&#xA0;</sup>for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, &#x2018;For we are also His offspring.&#x2019; <sup class="versenum">29&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, something shaped by art and man&#x2019;s devising. <sup class="versenum">30&#xA0;</sup>Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent, <sup class="versenum">31&#xA0;</sup>because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">32&#xA0;</sup>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, while others said, &#x201C;We will hear you again on this <i>matter.</i>&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">33&#xA0;</sup>So Paul departed from among them. <sup class="versenum">34&#xA0;</sup>However, some men joined him and believed, among them Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.'

_<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:12, ">Galatians 4:12, </a>NIrV_

`Read <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 9:19–23 ">1 Corinthians 9:19–23. </a>What does Paul say in these verses that helps us understand what he means in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:12">Galatians 4:12</a>? (Read also <a class="verse" verse="Acts 17:16–34;">Acts 17:16–34;</a> <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 8:8–13; ">1 Corinthians 8:8–13; </a>and <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 2:11–14">Galatians 2:11–14.</a>)`

<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:12 ">Galatians 4:12 </a>can seem a little confusing. For example, Paul tells the Galatians to become like him. But why should the Galatians become like Paul when Paul has already become like them?

Yesterday, we learned that Paul wanted the Galatians to be like him in his faith and trust in Christ to save. Paul told the Galatians he had become like them. His becoming like them was meant to remind them of how he became a Gentile. Gentiles are non-Jews. And Paul acted as a Gentile, even though he was a Jew. Indeed, he “became” a Gentile so that he could reach the Gentiles with the gospel. Paul was the great missionary to the Gentiles. He had learned to preach the gospel to both Jews and Gentiles. In fact, <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 9:19–23 ">1 Corinthians 9:19–23 </a>tells us that the gospel Paul preached always remained the same. But he used different methods to reach different people.

“Paul was a pioneer. He felt the need to communicate the gospel to others so that it seemed to fit all parts of their lives.”—Adapted, Timothy George, The New American Commentary [Explanation]: Galatians (Nashville, TN: Broadman & Holman Publishers, 1994), page 321.

Paul’s own words in <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 9:21 ">1 Corinthians 9:21 </a>show that he believed there were limits to how far someone should go in making the gospel seem to fit all parts of life. For example, a person is free to reach out in different ways to Jews and Gentiles. But this freedom does not include the right to break the law of God. Why? Because Christians are under the “law of Christ” (NLT).

Showing how important the gospel is to every part of life is not always easy. But “we should do what Paul did to show others how the gospel fits all parts of their lives.”—Adapted, Timothy George, Galatians, pages 321, 322.

`It often is easy to compromise.To compromise means to give in part way to what is wrong and to go against what is right. How have you compromised in your life? What excuses have you made for compromising? And what can you do to change?`
