            '1 Corinthians 9:20;': '<h3>1 Corinthians 9:20</h3><sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those <i>who are</i> under the law, as under the law, that I might win those <i>who are</i> under the law; '
            'Galatians 3:21–25;': '<h3>Galatians 3:21-25</h3><sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup><i>Is</i> the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the law was our tutor <i>to bring us</i> to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.'
            'Leviticus 18:5;': '<h3>Leviticus 18:5</h3><sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>You shall therefore keep My statutes and My judgments, which if a man does, he shall live by them: I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.'
            'Galatians 3:22,': '<h3>Galatians 3:22</h3><sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. '
            'Romans 3:9–19;': '<h3>Romans 3:9-19</h3><sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>What then? Are we better <i>than they?</i> Not at all.

            'Romans 3:1, 2;': '<h3>Romans 3:1, 2</h3><span class="chapternum">3&#xA0;</span>What advantage then has the Jew, or what <i>is</i> the profit of circumcision? <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>Much in every way! Chiefly because to them were committed the oracles of God. '
            'Romans 8:1–4': '<h3>Romans 8:1-4.</h3><span class="chapternum">8&#xA0;</span><i>There is</i> therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God <i>did</i> by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “Are God’s laws and God’s promises against each other? Of course not! [Suppose] we could be saved by his laws, then God would not have had to give us a different way to get out of the grip of sin—for the Scriptures [Bible] insist we are all its prisoners. The only way out is through faith in Jesus Christ; the way of escape is open to all who believe him”(<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:22,">Galatians 3:22,</a>TLB).

Homing pigeons are trained to fly home from a great distance. They can fly hundreds of miles a day and arrive at the end of their journey with great skill. But even the best homing pigeons have gotten lost and not returned home. The worst known case happened in England when about 55,000 birds never came back to their lofts.

Most of us have gotten lost at least once. And sometimes we can lose our way, as the pigeons did, even after we accept Christ.

The good news is that God has not left us alone. He has mapped out the road to faith.The“map”of this“road”is found in the gospel. And the road to faith includes the law. Many people try to separate the law from the gospel. Some even see the law and the gospel as fighting against each other. This view is dead wrong. And it often can lead to terrible results. Without the law, we would have no gospel. Indeed, it is hard to understand the gospel without the law.
