        verses:
            'Galatians 3:15–20;': '<h3>Galatians 3:15-20</h3><sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though <i>it is</i> only a man&#x2019;s covenant, yet <i>if it is</i> confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, &#x201C;And to seeds,&#x201D; as of many, but as of one, <span class="oblique">&#x201C;And to your Seed,&#x201D;</span> who is Christ. <sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>And this I say, <i>that</i> the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>For if the inheritance <i>is</i> of the law, <i>it is</i> no longer of promise; but God gave <i>it</i> to Abraham by promise.<sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>What purpose then <i>does</i> the law <i>serve?</i> It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; <i>and it was</i> appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator. <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>Now a mediator does not <i>mediate</i> for one <i>only,</i> but God is one.'
            'Genesis 9:11–17;': '<h3>Genesis 9:11-17</h3><sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>Thus I establish My covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood; never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>And God said: &#x201C;This <i>is</i> the sign of the covenant which I make between Me and you, and every living creature that <i>is</i> with you, for perpetual generations: <sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth. <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>It shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud; <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>and I will remember My covenant which <i>is</i> between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will look on it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that <i>is</i> on the earth.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>And God said to Noah, &#x201C;This <i>is</i> the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that <i>is</i> on the earth.&#x201D;'
            'Matthew 5:17–20;': '<h3>Matthew 5:17-20</h3><sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">&#x201C;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.</span> <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.</span> <sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches <i>them,</i> he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds <i>the righteousness</i> of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.</span>'
            'Exodus 16:22–26;': '<h3>Exodus 16:22-26</h3><sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>And so it was, on the sixth day, <i>that</i> they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>Then he said to them, &#x201C;This <i>is what</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has said: &#x2018;Tomorrow <i>is</i> a Sabbath rest, a holy Sabbath to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Bake what you will bake <i>today,</i> and boil what you will boil; and lay up for yourselves all that remains, to be kept until morning.&#x2019;&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>So they laid it up till morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not stink, nor were there any worms in it. <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>Then Moses said, &#x201C;Eat that today, for today <i>is</i> a Sabbath to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; today you will not find it in the field. <sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none.&#x201D;'
            'Galatians 3:18, ': '<h3>Galatians 3:18</h3><sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>For if the inheritance <i>is</i> of the law, <i>it is</i> no longer of promise; but God gave <i>it</i> to Abraham by promise.'
            'Genesis 15:1–6': '<h3>Genesis 15:1-6.</h3><span class="chapternum">15&#xA0;</span>After these things the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to Abram in a vision, saying, &#x201C;Do not be afraid, Abram. I <i>am</i> your shield, your exceedingly great reward.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>But Abram said, &#x201C;Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, what will You give me, seeing I go childless, and the heir of my house <i>is</i> Eliezer of Damascus?&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Then Abram said, &#x201C;Look, You have given me no offspring; indeed one born in my house is my heir!&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>And behold, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> <i>came</i> to him, saying, &#x201C;This one shall not be your heir, but one who will come from your own body shall be your heir.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>Then He brought him outside and said, &#x201C;Look now toward heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them.&#x201D; And He said to him, &#x201C;So shall your descendants be.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>And he believed in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and He accounted it to him for righteousness.'
            'Isaiah 46:11, ': '<h3>Isaiah 46:11</h3><sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>Calling a bird of prey from the east,The man who executes My counsel, from a far country.Indeed I have spoken <i>it;</i>I will also bring it to pass.I have purposed <i>it;</i>I will also do it.'

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “The great gift that God has for us does not depend on the law. If it did, it would no longer depend on the promise. But God gave it to Abraham as a free gift through a promise” (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:18, ">Galatians 3:18, </a>NIrV).

A top adviser to a president was asked, “Has the president kept all the promises that he made during his campaign?” The adviser answered, “The president has kept all the promises he intended to keep.”

At one time or another, who has not broken a promise? And who has not had a promise made to him or her broken?

Sometimes people make promises, and they fully mean to keep them. But later on, they break them. Others make promises they never mean to keep at all. It is all a lie.

But we are very blessed, because God’s promises are different. The Bible is sure. So, we can trust God to do what He says. “ ‘I will bring about what I have said. I will do what I have planned’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Isaiah 46:11, ">Isaiah 46:11, </a>NIrV).

In this week’s lesson, Paul points our attention to a special relationship. It is the relationship between God’s promises to Abraham and the law given to Israel 430 years later. What is the relationship between God’s promises and the law? And how does that relationship change the way the gospel is preached?
