            'Jeremiah 9:23, 24, ': '<h3>Jeremiah 9:23, 24</h3><sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>:&#x201C;Let not the wise <i>man</i> glory in his wisdom,Let not the mighty <i>man</i> glory in his might,Nor let the rich <i>man</i> glory in his riches;<h3>Jeremiah 9: 24</h3><sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>But let him who glories glory in this,That he understands and knows Me,That I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, exercising lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth.For in these I delight,&#x201D; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.'
            '2 Corinthians 4:10;': '<h3>2 Corinthians 4:10</h3><sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. '
            '2 Corinthians 5:17;': '<h3>2 Corinthians 5:17</h3><sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, if anyone <i>is</i> in Christ, <i>he is</i> a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. '
            'Galatians 6:11–18;': '<h3>Galatians 6:11-18</h3><sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand! <sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, these <i>would</i> compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. <sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>For not even those who are circumcised keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation.<sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy <i>be</i> upon them, and upon the Israel of God.<sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.<sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with your spirit.

            'Galatians 6:14, ': '<h3>Galatians 6:14</h3><sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. '
            'Romans 12:1–8;': '<h3>Romans 12:1-8</h3><span class="chapternum">12&#xA0;</span>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, <i>which is</i> your reasonable service. <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what <i>is</i> that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.<sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think <i>of himself</i> more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith. <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function, <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>so we, <i>being</i> many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another. <sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, <i>let us use them:</i> if prophecy, <i>let us prophesy</i> in proportion to our faith; <sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>or ministry, <i>let us use it</i> in <i>our</i> ministering; he who teaches, in teaching; <sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.'
            'Romans 6:1–6;': '<h3>Romans 6:1-6</h3><span class="chapternum">6&#xA0;</span>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it? <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.<sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be <i>in the likeness</i> of <i>His</i> resurrection, <sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>knowing this, that our old man was crucified with <i>Him,</i> that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin.

> “I do not want to be proud of anything except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of the cross, the ways of this world are dead to me, and I am dead to them” (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 6:14, ">Galatians 6:14, </a>NLV). 

Paul writes with all the strong feeling of an Old Testament prophet. A prophet is a special messenger sent by God to His people. Such prophets included Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Hosea. These men begged God’s people to turn away from their sins and wrong thinking. Paul in his own day gives the same message to God’s people. 

True, the situation Jeremiah was dealing with may have been very different from the one in Paul’s time. But the words of Jeremiah just as easily could have been written to the Galatians: “The LORD says, ‘Do not let wise people brag about how wise they are. Do not let strong people boast about how strong they are. Do not let rich people brag about how rich they are. But here is what the one who brags should boast about. They should brag that they have the understanding to know me. . . . No matter what I do on earth, I am always kind, fair and right’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Jeremiah 9:23, 24, ">Jeremiah 9:23, 24, </a>NIrV). 

Before the Cross of Jesus, all our greatness is nothing. And the Cross is at the heart of Paul’s letter to the flock in Galatia who has wandered away from the truth.
