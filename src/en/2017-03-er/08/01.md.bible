            'Galatians 3:26–4:20;': '<h3>Galatians 3:26-4:20</h3><span class="chapternum">3&#xA0;</span>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified? <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh? <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>Have you suffered so many things in vain&#x2014;if indeed <i>it was</i> in vain?<sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, <i>does He do it</i> by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>just as Abraham <span class="oblique">&#x201C;believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore know that <i>only</i> those who are of faith are sons of Abraham. <sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, <i>saying,</i> <span class="oblique">&#x201C;In you all the nations shall be blessed.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>So then those who <i>are</i> of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.<sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, <span class="oblique">&#x201C;Cursed</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God <i>is</i> evident, for <span class="oblique">&#x201C;the just shall live by faith.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>Yet the law is not of faith, but <span class="oblique">&#x201C;the man who does them shall live by them.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, <span class="oblique">&#x201C;Cursed</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">everyone who hangs on a tree&#x201D;</span>),<sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.<sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though <i>it is</i> only a man&#x2019;s covenant, yet <i>if it is</i> confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, &#x201C;And to seeds,&#x201D; as of many, but as of one, <span class="oblique">&#x201C;And to your Seed,&#x201D;</span> who is Christ. <sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>And this I say, <i>that</i> the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>For if the inheritance <i>is</i> of the law, <i>it is</i> no longer of promise; but God gave <i>it</i> to Abraham by promise.<sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>What purpose then <i>does</i> the law <i>serve?</i> It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; <i>and it was</i> appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator. <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>Now a mediator does not <i>mediate</i> for one <i>only,</i> but God is one.<sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup><i>Is</i> the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the law was our tutor <i>to bring us</i> to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.<sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. <sup class="versenum">27&#xA0;</sup>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. <sup class="versenum">28&#xA0;</sup>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <sup class="versenum">29&#xA0;</sup>And if you <i>are</i> Christ&#x2019;s, then you are Abraham&#x2019;s seed, and heirs according to the promise.'
            'Hebrews 4:14, 15;': '<h3>Hebrews 4:14, 15</h3><sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i>our</i> confession. <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all <i>points</i> tempted as <i>we are, yet</i> without sin. '
            'Hebrews 2:14–18;': '<h3>Hebrews 2:14-18</h3><sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham. <sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, in all things He had to be made like <i>His</i> brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things <i>pertaining</i> to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted.'
            'Galatians 4:7, ': '<h3>Galatians 4:7</h3><sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.'
            'Romans 6:1–11;': '<h3>Romans 6:1-11</h3><span class="chapternum">6&#xA0;</span>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it? <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.<sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be <i>in the likeness</i> of <i>His</i> resurrection, <sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>knowing this, that our old man was crucified with <i>Him,</i> that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. <sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>For he who has died has been freed from sin. <sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, <sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. <sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>For <i>the death</i> that He died, He died to sin once for all; but <i>the life</i> that He lives, He lives to God. <sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.'
            'Romans 9:4, 5': '<h3>Romans 9:4, 5.</h3><sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>who are Israelites, to whom <i>pertain</i> the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service <i>of God,</i> and the promises; <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>of whom <i>are</i> the fathers and from whom, according to the flesh, Christ <i>came,</i> who is over all, <i>the</i> eternally blessed God. Amen.'

> “So you [are not] a slave any longer. You are God’s child. Because you are his child, God gives you the rights of those who are his children” (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:7, ">Galatians 4:7, </a>NIrV).

Paul tells the Galatians they are not slaves. Instead, they are the sons and daughters of God. So, they should live their lives with this truth in mind. Martin Luther needed to hear this truth when he was a young man. Luther was a monk. A monk is a religious man who lives and works with other religious men. But Luther’s life as a monk brought him no peace. Luther believed he was a guilty sinner. He tried by his own works to receive pardon and peace. He fasted, or went without food. And he whipped himself to try to get rid of his sin. He would have done anything to be able to stand with a pure heart before God. He followed all the rules. But he could find no peace inside himself. He said, “Suppose there were a monk who could earn heaven by his works. Then that monk would have been me. I should have earned it through all I did.”—Adapted. But nothing he did seemed to work.

But then Martin Luther read Galatians. And he began to understand the truth about salvation in Christ. Only then did Luther start to have spiritual freedom. He found hope for his soul. Luther’s hope changed the world. And the world has never been the same since.
