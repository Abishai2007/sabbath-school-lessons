            'Hebrews 4:14, 15 ': '<h3>Hebrews 4:14, 15.</h3><sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i>our</i> confession. <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all <i>points</i> tempted as <i>we are, yet</i> without sin.

            'Daniel 9:24–27': '<h3>Daniel 9:24-27</h3><sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Seventy weeks are determinedFor your people and for your holy city,To finish the transgression,To make an end of sins,To make reconciliation for iniquity,To bring in everlasting righteousness,To seal up vision and prophecy,And to anoint the Most Holy.<sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Know therefore and understand,<i>That</i> from the going forth of the commandTo restore and build JerusalemUntil Messiah the Prince,<i>There shall be</i> seven weeks and sixty-two weeks;The street shall be built again, and the wall,Even in troublesome times.<sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;And after the sixty-two weeksMessiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself;And the people of the prince who is to comeShall destroy the city and the sanctuary.The end of it <i>shall be</i> with a flood,And till the end of the war desolations are determined.<sup class="versenum">27&#xA0;</sup>Then he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week;But in the middle of the weekHe shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering.And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate,Even until the consummation, which is determined,Is poured out on the desolate.&#x201D;'
            'Romans 5:12–21': '<h3>Romans 5:12-21</h3><sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>(For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come. <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>But the free gift <i>is</i> not like the offense. For if by the one man&#x2019;s offense many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>And the gift <i>is</i> not like <i>that which came</i> through the one who sinned.

But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, <sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.'

_<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:4, ">Galatians 4:4, </a>NIrV_

In <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:4, ">Galatians 4:4, </a>Paul uses the word “chosen” to show how God personally worked out His plan to save us. Jesus did not come at just any time. He came at the exact time God chose. It was a very good time in history, known as the Pax Romana. Pax Romana means Roman peace. It lasted for more than 200 years. It was a time when people felt safe and secure across the Roman Empire. Rome had conquered the Mediterranean world. This victory brought peace. It made travel easier. People also spoke the same language, and they shared the same way of life. These things helped to spread the gospel quickly. God chose this time for the coming of His Son (read <a class="verse" verse="Daniel 9:24–27">Daniel 9:24–27</a>).

`Read <a class="verse" verse="John 1:14;">John 1:14;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:4, 5;">Galatians 4:4, 5;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Romans 8:3, 4;">Romans 8:3, 4;</a> <a class="verse" verse="2 Corinthians 5:21;">2 Corinthians 5:21;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Philippians 2:5–8;">Philippians 2:5–8;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Hebrews 2:14–18; ">Hebrews 2:14–18; </a>and <a class="verse" verse="Hebrews 4:14, 15 ">Hebrews 4:14, 15. </a>According to these verses, why did Jesus need to become human to save us?`

<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:4, 5 ">Galatians 4:4, 5 </a>is one of the shortest descriptions of the gospel in the whole Bible. It tells how Jesus came into human history. His coming was no accident. For God took the first step toward saving us. The words “God sent His Son” teach that Jesus is God (<a class="verse" verse="John 1:1–3, 18;">John 1:1–3, 18;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Philippians 2:5–9;">Philippians 2:5–9;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Colossians 1:15–17">Colossians 1:15–17</a>). God did not send us a heavenly messenger. God Himself came, for only God could save us.

Jesus is God. He is God’s own Son. He has been with God from the beginning. But “a woman gave birth to him” (NIrV). This verse tells us Jesus truly became human.

The wording “born under the law” (NKJV) points to the fact that Jesus was born in order to die for our sins.

Christ needed to become human. Why? Because we could not save ourselves. He is divine. But He joined Himself with fallen humans. By doing so, Christ became our legal Substitute, Savior, and High Priest. He was the “second” Adam. He came to win back everything the first Adam lost by disobeying God (<a class="verse" verse="Romans 5:12–21">Romans 5:12–21</a>). Christ was obedient to the law. He met all the law’s holy requirements. He won the victory where Adam failed. Christ’s death on the cross satisfied the just requirements of the law. The law demanded the death of the sinner. But Christ died in our place. And His death gave Him the right to save all who come to Him in true faith and surrender to Him.
