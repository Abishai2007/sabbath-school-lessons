            'Romans 8:15, 16, 23; ': '<h3>Romans 8:15, 16, 23</h3><sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, &#x201C;Abba, Father.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>Not only <i>that,</i> but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body. '
            'Galatians 4:1–9: ': '<h3>Galatians 4:1-9:</h3><span class="chapternum">4&#xA0;</span>Now I say <i>that</i> the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all, <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world. <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.<sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, &#x201C;Abba, Father!&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.<sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods. <sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>But now after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how <i>is it that</i> you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage? <sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>You observe days and months and seasons and years. <sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain.<sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I <i>became</i> like you. You have not injured me at all. <sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first. <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, <i>even</i> as Christ Jesus. <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>What then was the blessing you <i>enjoyed?</i> For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?<sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>They zealously court you, <i>but</i> for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you. <sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you, <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.<sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>But he <i>who was</i> of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. <sup class="versenum">27&#xA0;</sup>For it is written:<span class="oblique">&#x201C;Rejoice, O barren,</span><i>You</i> <span class="oblique">who do not bear!</span><span class="oblique">Break forth and shout,</span><span class="oblique">You who are not in labor!</span><span class="oblique">For the desolate has many more children</span><span class="oblique">Than she who has a husband.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">28&#xA0;</sup>Now we, brethren, as Isaac <i>was,</i> are children of promise. <sup class="versenum">29&#xA0;</sup>But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him <i>who was born</i> according to the Spirit, even so <i>it is</i> now. <sup class="versenum">30&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? <span class="oblique">&#x201C;Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">31&#xA0;</sup>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.'

_<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:5–7">Galatians 4:5–7</a>_

In <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:5, ">Galatians 4:5, </a>Paul says that Christ “came to set free those who were under the authority of the law” (NIrV). The wording “to set free” means “to buy back.” It pointed to the price paid to buy the freedom of a hostage or slave. This wording shows something negative about salvation. It shows we are slaves who need to be set free.

But freed from what? The New Testament lists four main things: (1) the devil and his lies (<a class="verse" verse="Hebrews 2:14, 15">Hebrews 2:14, 15</a>); (2) death (<a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 15:56, 57">1 Corinthians 15:56, 57</a>); (3) the power of sin that enslaves us (<a class="verse" verse="Romans 6:22">Romans 6:22</a>); and (4) the guilt of breaking the law (<a class="verse" verse="Romans 3:19–24;">Romans 3:19–24;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:13; ">Galatians 3:13; </a>and <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:5">Galatians 4:5</a>).

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:5–7;">Galatians 4:5–7;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Ephesians 1:5;">Ephesians 1:5;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Romans 8:15, 16, 23; ">Romans 8:15, 16, 23; </a>and <a class="verse" verse="Romans 9:4, 5 ">Romans 9:4, 5. </a>What special blessing comes to us as a result of our being saved in Christ?`

We often describe what Christ has done for us as salvation. But this word is not nearly as rich as Paul’s use of the word “adoption” (huiothesia). Paul is the only New Testament writer to use this word. Adoption was a well-known custom in the Greco-Roman world. Several Roman emperors during Paul’s lifetime had no legal heirs. So, they adopted the person who would rule after them. Adoption resulted in certain benefits: “(1) The adopted son becomes the true son . . . of the one who adopted him. . . . (2) The one who adopted the son agrees to raise the child and to give him food and clothing. (3) The one doing the adopting cannot refuse to accept his adopted son. (4) The child cannot be made a slave. (5) The child’s birth parents cannot take him back. (6) Adoption gives the child the right to inherit.” —Adapted, Derek R. Moore-Crispin, “<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:1–9: ">Galatians 4:1–9: </a>The Use and Abuse of Parallels,” The Evangelical Quarterly, volume LXI, number 3 (1989), page 216.

All these rights are made certain by law. But just imagine how much greater the benefits are that we have as the adopted children of God!

`The Hebrew word Abba, in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:6, ">Galatians 4:6, </a>was the word children used for their fathers. It is the same as Daddy or Papa today. Jesus used it in prayer (<a class="verse" verse="Mark 14:36">Mark 14:36</a>). It is our right to use it, as well. How does it make you feel to know we can use it, too?`
