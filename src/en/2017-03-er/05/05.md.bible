            '2 Samuel 12:1–13': '<h3> <span>2 Samuel 12:1-13</span></h3><p><span><span>12&#xA0;</span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him: &#x201C;There were two men in one city, one rich and the other poor. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>The rich <i>man</i> had exceedingly many flocks and herds. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>But the poor <i>man</i> had nothing, except one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished; and it grew up together with him and with his children. It ate of his own food and drank from his own cup and lay in his bosom; and it was like a daughter to him. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And a traveler came to the rich man, who refused to take from his own flock and from his own herd to prepare one for the wayfaring man who had come to him; but he took the poor man&#x2019;s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>So David&#x2019;s anger was greatly aroused against the man, and he said to Nathan, &#x201C;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> lives, the man who has done this shall surely die! </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And he shall restore fourfold for the lamb, because he did this thing and because he had no pity.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Then Nathan said to David, &#x201C;You <i>are</i> the man! Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> God of Israel: &#x2018;I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>I gave you your master&#x2019;s house and your master&#x2019;s wives into your keeping, and gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if <i>that had been</i> too little, I also would have given you much more! </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Why have you despised the commandment of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, to do evil in His sight? You have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword; you have taken his wife <i>to be</i> your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the people of Ammon. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.&#x2019; </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>: &#x2018;Behold, I will raise up adversity against you from your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and give <i>them</i> to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>For you did <i>it</i> secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, before the sun.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>So David said to Nathan, &#x201C;I have sinned against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>And Nathan said to David, &#x201C;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> also has put away your sin; you shall not die. </span> </p>'

The <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! <i>Is</i> this not a brand plucked from the fire?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the Angel.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Then He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, &#x201C;Take away the filthy garments from him.&#x201D; And to him He said, &#x201C;See, I have removed your iniquity from you, and I will clothe you with rich robes.&#x201D;</span></p>'

And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>But the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> called to him from heaven and said, &#x201C;Abraham, Abraham!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>So he said, &#x201C;Here I am.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And He said, &#x201C;Do not lay your hand on the lad, or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only <i>son,</i> from Me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Then Abraham lifted his eyes and looked, and there behind <i>him was</i> a ram caught in a thicket by its horns.

_<a class="verse" verse="Genesis 12:1–3">Genesis 12:1–3</a>_

In <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:8">Galatians 3:8</a>, Paul says that the gospel was preached to Abraham. And God was the one who preached it. But when did God preach the gospel to Abraham? To answer that question, Paul quotes <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 12:3">Genesis 12:3</a>. This verse is part of God’s agreement with Abraham in <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 12:1–3">Genesis 12:1–3</a>.

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 12:1–3">Genesis 12:1–3</a>. What do these verses tell us about the agreement God made with Abram [Abraham]?`

God’s special agreement was called a covenant. God’s promises were at the center of His covenant with Abraham. God says to Abraham five times, “I will” (NIrV) do this or that. God’s promises to Abraham are marvelous. Why? Because God makes all the promises. And Abraham promises nothing. Most people do not think of God as the One in the relationship who does everything. Instead, we usually promise we will serve Him. In return, we ask Him to do something for us. But that is just another form of trying to be saved by your own efforts. God did not ask Abraham to promise anything. He asked Abraham only to accept His promises by faith. Of course, that was not an easy thing to do. Why? Because Abraham had to learn to trust completely in God and not in himself. (Read <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 22">Genesis 22</a>.) Abraham’s story shows us that the gospel is about being saved by faith.

Some think that the Bible teaches two ways of being saved. They say the Old Testament teaches that people were saved by obeying the law. But that way of being saved did not work. So, they say God got rid of the law. Then He made a new way of being saved. The new way was by faith. But this thinking is false in every way. Paul says so himself in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 1:7">Galatians 1:7</a>. There is only one gospel.

`What other Old Testament examples can you find that show we are saved by faith? (Read <a class="verse" verse="Leviticus 17:11">Leviticus 17:11</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Psalm 32:1–5">Psalm 32:1–5</a>; <a class="verse" verse="2 Samuel 12:1–13">2 Samuel 12:1–13</a>; and <a class="verse" verse="Zechariah 3:1–4">Zechariah 3:1–4</a>.)`

`People often talk of “cheap grace.” Grace is God’s gift of forgiveness, mercy, and power over sin. So, cheap grace is a wrong use of words. Grace is free. But it is not cheap. We ruin the idea of grace when we (1) think we can add our own works to it or (2) use it as an excuse to sin. How do we avoid either of these two traps?`
