            'Galatians 3:1–14': '<h3> <span>Galatians 3:1-14</span></h3><p><span><span>3&#xA0;</span>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified? </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh? </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Have you suffered so many things in vain&#x2014;if indeed <i>it was</i> in vain?</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, <i>does He do it</i> by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>just as Abraham <span>&#x201C;believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore know that <i>only</i> those who are of faith are sons of Abraham. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, <i>saying,</i> <span>&#x201C;In you all the nations shall be blessed.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>So then those who <i>are</i> of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, <span>&#x201C;Cursed</span> <i>is</i> <span>everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God <i>is</i> evident, for <span>&#x201C;the just shall live by faith.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Yet the law is not of faith, but <span>&#x201C;the man who does them shall live by them.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, <span>&#x201C;Cursed</span> <i>is</i> <span>everyone who hangs on a tree&#x201D;</span>),</span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span></p>'

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “Christ set us free from the curse of the law. He did it by becoming a curse for us. It is written, ‘Everyone who is hung on a pole is under God’s curse’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:13">Galatians 3:13</a>, NIrV).

“A little boy made and painted a toy boat. But one day his beautiful boat was stolen. The boy was very upset. Soon after, he happened to pass a shop that sold used goods. He looked in the window and saw his boat. Happiness filled him. He ran inside and said to the shopkeeper, ‘That is my boat!’ ‘No,’ the shopkeeper said. ‘It is mine. I bought it.’ ‘Yes,’ the boy said, ‘but it is mine, for I made it.’ ‘Well,’ the shopkeeper said, ‘I will sell it back to you for two dollars.’Two dollars was a lot of money for a boy who did not have a penny. But he wanted the boat so badly. So he cut lawns. He did chores. And soon he had the money.

“The boy ran down to the shop and bought the boat. He took the boat up in his arms. He hugged and kissed it. He said, ‘You dear little boat. I love you. You are mine. You are mine twice. I made you. And now I have bought you.’

“The same is true with us.We are, in a way, twice the Lord’s. He made us. But we ended up in the devil’s secondhand shop. Then Jesus came. He bought us at a very high price. He did not pay silver or gold, but His precious blood. We are twice the Lord’s because first He created us and then He saved us.”—Adapted, William Moses Tidwell, Pointed Illustrations (Kansas City, MO: Beacon Hill Press, 1951), page 97.
