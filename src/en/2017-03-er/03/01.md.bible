            '1 Corinthians 1:10–13': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 1:10-13</span></h3><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Now I plead with you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and <i>that</i> there be no divisions among you, but <i>that</i> you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of Chloe&#x2019;s <i>household,</i> that there are contentions among you. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Now I say this, that each of you says, &#x201C;I am of Paul,&#x201D; or &#x201C;I am of Apollos,&#x201D; or &#x201C;I am of Cephas,&#x201D; or &#x201C;I am of Christ.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</span></p>'
            'Galatians 2:1–14': '<h3> <span>Galatians 2:1-14</span></h3><p><span><span>2&#xA0;</span>Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and also took Titus with <i>me.</i> </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of reputation, lest by any means I might run, or had run, in vain. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Yet not even Titus who <i>was</i> with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And <i>this occurred</i> because of false brethren secretly brought in (who came in by stealth to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage), </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>to whom we did not yield submission even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>But from those who seemed to be something&#x2014;whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God shows personal favoritism to no man&#x2014;for those who seemed <i>to be something</i> added nothing to me. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel for the uncircumcised had been committed to me, as <i>the gospel</i> for the circumcised <i>was</i> to Peter </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>(for He who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised also worked effectively in me toward the Gentiles), </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that had been given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we <i>should go</i> to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup><i>They desired</i> only that we should remember the poor, the very thing which I also was eager to do.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed; </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>for before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before <i>them</i> all, &#x201C;If you, being a Jew, live in the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews, why do you compel Gentiles to live as Jews? </span> </p>'
            'Genesis 17:1–21': '<h3> <span>Genesis 17:1-21</span></h3><p><span><span>17&#xA0;</span>When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to Abram and said to him, &#x201C;I <i>am</i> Almighty God; walk before Me and be blameless. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And I will make My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying: </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of many nations. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you a father of many nations. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Also I give to you and your descendants after you the land in which you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>And God said to Abraham: &#x201C;As for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>This <i>is</i> My covenant which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: Every male child among you shall be circumcised; </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>and you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and you. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised, every male child in your generations, he who is born in your house or bought with money from any foreigner who is not your descendant. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised, and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And the uncircumcised male child, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Then God said to Abraham, &#x201C;As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah <i>shall be</i> her name. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And I will bless her and also give you a son by her; then I will bless her, and she shall be <i>a mother of</i> nations; kings of peoples shall be from her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, &#x201C;Shall <i>a child</i> be born to a man who is one hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear <i>a child?</i>&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>And Abraham said to God, &#x201C;Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Then God said: &#x201C;No, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, <i>and</i> with his descendants after him. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall beget twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this set time next year.&#x201D; </span> </p>'
            'Colossians 3:11': '<h3> <span>Colossians 3:11</span></h3><p> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave <i>nor</i> free, but Christ <i>is</i> all and in all.</span></p>'
            'Philippians 2:2': '<h3> <span>Philippians 2:2</span></h3><p> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, <i>being</i> of one accord, of one mind. </span> </p>'
            'John 8:31–36': '<h3> <span>John 8:31-36</span></h3><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, <span>&#x201C;If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed.</span> </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup><span>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>They answered Him, &#x201C;We are Abraham&#x2019;s descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How <i>can</i> You say, <span>&#x2018;You will be made free&#x2019;</span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Jesus answered them, <span>&#x201C;Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave of sin.</span> </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup><span>And a slave does not abide in the house forever, <i>but</i> a son abides forever.</span> </span> <span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup><span>Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.</span></span></p>'

> “If any of these things has happened to you, then agree with one another. Have the same love. Be one in spirit and in the way you think and act. By doing this, you will make my joy complete”(<a class="verse" verse="Philippians 2:2">Philippians 2:2</a>, NIrV).

John Calvin was a church reformer. A reformer works to improve things. Calvin believed that the devil used two “weapons” to attack the church: (1) disagreements and (2) division or splitting up the church.Calvin warned that Christians should avoid anything that divides the church.

But is keeping the church together more important than the truth? In answer to this question, think about Martin Luther. He was also a reformer. Luther was brought to trial at the Diet of Worms for believing that we are saved by faith alone.

“But suppose Luther chose at his trial to give up his beliefs so that the church would not split apart. Then Satan and his followers would have won a great victory. But Luther’s firm stand for the truth set the church free. It started a new and better time for the church.”—Adapted, Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy [War Between Christ and Satan], page 166.

In <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 2:1–14">Galatians 2:1–14</a>, Paul does all he can to keep the church together. But he refuses to allow the gospel to be weakened in order to have agreement. There is room for different ideas in the church. But the gospel should not be weakened to keep the church together.
