            'Galatians 4:7, 8': '<h3> <span>Galatians 4:7</span></h3><p> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</span></p><h3> <span>Galatians 4:8</span></h3><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods. </span> </p>'
            'Hebrews 2:14, 15': '<h3> <span>Hebrews 2:14</span></h3><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, </span> </p><h3> <span>Hebrews 2:15</span></h3><p> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. </span> </p>'
            'Galatians 2:7': '<h3> <span>Galatians 2:7</span></h3><p> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel for the uncircumcised had been committed to me, as <i>the gospel</i> for the circumcised <i>was</i> to Peter </span> </p>'
            'Galatians 2:4': '<h3> <span>Galatians 2:4</span></h3><p> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And <i>this occurred</i> because of false brethren secretly brought in (who came in by stealth to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage), </span> </p>'
            'Romans 6:6, 7': '<h3> <span>Romans 6:6</span></h3><p> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>knowing this, that our old man was crucified with <i>Him,</i> that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. </span> </p><h3> <span>Romans 6:7</span></h3><p> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>For he who has died has been freed from sin. </span> </p>'
            'Romans 8:2, 3': '<h3> <span>Romans 8:2</span></h3><p> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. </span> </p><h3> <span>Romans 8:3</span></h3><p> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God <i>did</i> by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, </span> </p>'
            'John 8:31–36': '<h3> <span>John 8:31-36</span></h3><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, <span>&#x201C;If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed.</span> </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup><span>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>They answered Him, &#x201C;We are Abraham&#x2019;s descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How <i>can</i> You say, <span>&#x2018;You will be made free&#x2019;</span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Jesus answered them, <span>&#x201C;Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave of sin.</span> </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup><span>And a slave does not abide in the house forever, <i>but</i> a son abides forever.</span> </span> <span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup><span>Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.</span></span></p>'

_<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 2:7">Galatians 2:7</a>_

`In <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 2:4">Galatians 2:4</a>,Paul says,“Some people had slipped in among us. They had pretended to be believers. They wanted to find out about the freedom we have because we belong to Christ Jesus. They wanted to make us slaves again” (NIrV). What are Christians free from? For the answer, read <a class="verse" verse="John 8:31–36">John 8:31–36</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Romans 6:6, 7">Romans 6:6, 7</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Romans 8:2, 3">Romans 8:2, 3</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 3:23–25">Galatians 3:23–25</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:7, 8">Galatians 4:7, 8</a>; and <a class="verse" verse="Hebrews 2:14, 15">Hebrews 2:14, 15</a>. How do we experience this freedom ourselves?`

Freedom is an important idea for Paul. It describes for him the Christian experience. He uses the word more often than any other writer in the New Testament. And in his letter to the Galatians, he uses the words “free” and “freedom” many times.

Freedom is an important idea for the Christian too. For the Christian, it means to be free in Christ. It is the chance to live a faithful life of love to God without being held back from doing so. This new life includes freedom from three things: (1) the slavery of sin, (2) the guilt of breaking the law, and (3) the power of death.

`The apostles accepted the fact that God gave Paul a special work to do, just as He gave Peter (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 2:7">Galatians 2:7</a>, NIrV). Both men were sent to preach the same gospel to different groups of people. What does this fact tell us about how the gospel brings us all together as one in spite of our differences?`

The apostles believed God chose Paul to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. In the same way, God chose Peter to preach to the Jews. Both men preached the same gospel. But how they shared it depended on the people they tried to reach. “The gospel would bring all believers together as one in spite of differences in their backgrounds. This oneness, or unity, is what it means for Christians to be in agreement.”—Adapted, James D. G. Dunn, The Epistle [Letter] to the Galatians (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson Publishers, Inc., 1993), page 106.

`How open should we be to new forms of sharing the gospel? What forms of witnessing make you nervous, and why? How do we know if a new method is good?`
