            'Galatians 2:15–21': '<h3> <span>Galatians 2:15-21</span></h3><p> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>We <i>who are</i> Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, <i>is</i> Christ therefore a minister of sin?

            'Philippians 3:9': '<h3> <span>Philippians 3:9</span></h3><p> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which <i>is</i> from the law, but that which <i>is</i> through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith; </span> </p>'
            'Ephesians 2:12': '<h3> <span>Ephesians 2:12</span></h3><p> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. </span> </p>'
            'Romans 3:10–20': '<h3> <span>Romans 3:10-20</span></h3><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>As it is written:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x201C;There is none righteous, no, not one;</span></span><br><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup><span>There is none who understands;</span></span><br><span><span>There is none who seeks after God.</span></span><br><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup><span>They have all turned aside;</span></span><br><span><span>They have together become unprofitable;</span></span><br><span><span>There is none who does good, no, not one.&#x201D;</span></span><br><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;<span>Their throat <i>is</i> an open tomb;</span></span><br><span><span>With their tongues they have practiced deceit&#x201D;</span>; </span><br><span><span>&#x201C;The poison of asps</span> <i>is</i> <span>under their lips&#x201D;</span>; </span><br><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;Whose mouth <i>is</i> full of cursing and bitterness.&#x201D;</span></span><br><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;Their feet <i>are</i> swift to shed blood;</span></span><br><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup><span>Destruction and misery</span> <i>are</i> <span>in their ways;</span></span><br><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup><span>And the way of peace they have not known.&#x201D;</span></span><br><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;There is no fear of God before their eyes.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law <i>is</i> the knowledge of sin.</span></p>'

> “I have been crucified [put to death] with Christ. I [do not] live any longer, but Christ lives in me. Now I live my life in my body by faith in the Son of God. He loved me and gave himself for me” (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 2:20">Galatians 2:20</a>, NIrV).

Last week we read about how Paul stood up to Peter in Antioch. Paul scolded Peter for saying one thing but doing another. Peter chose to stop eating with Gentile Christians. Gentile Christians are non-Jewish believers. Peter’s choice sent a negative message to the Gentile Christians. His actions told them they were not as important as Jewish Christians. And what he did made it seem that Gentile believers must first be circumcised. To be circumcised means that the skin at the end of the sex organ of a man or a boy is cut off. Then Gentile males would be accepted into the family of God. But Paul made it clear to Peter that such ideas were wrong.

What were the actual words Paul said to Peter? This week, we will look at what probably happened. The verses in Paul’s letter about this topic pack a lot of information into just a small number of words. These new verses also are very important because they mention several words and groups of words for the first time. These new words also help us to understand the gospel and the rest of Paul’s letter to the Galatians. Some of these words include: works of law, belief, faith, and the faith of Jesus.

What does Paul mean by these words? And what do they teach us about the plan of salvation?
