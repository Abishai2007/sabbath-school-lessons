So you shall put away the evil from your midst.'
            'Galatians 5:16–25;': '<h3>Galatians 5:16-25</h3><sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. <sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.<sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, <sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told <i>you</i> in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.<sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>And those <i>who are</i> Christ&#x2019;s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. '
            'Matthew 22:35–40': '<h3>Matthew 22:35-40</h3><sup class="versenum">35&#xA0;</sup>Then one of them, a lawyer, asked <i>Him a question,</i> testing Him, and saying, <sup class="versenum">36&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Teacher, which <i>is</i> the great commandment in the law?&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">37&#xA0;</sup>Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#x201C;&#x2018;You shall love the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.&#x2019;</span> <sup class="versenum">38&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">This is <i>the</i> first and great commandment.</span> <sup class="versenum">39&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">And <i>the</i> second <i>is</i> like it: &#x2018;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#x2019;</span> <sup class="versenum">40&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.&#x201D;</span>'

            'Romans 7:14–24;': '<h3>Romans 7:14-24</h3><sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin. <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>For what I am doing, I do not understand. For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate, that I do. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>If, then, I do what I will not to do, I agree with the law that <i>it is</i> good. <sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>But now, <i>it is</i> no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but <i>how</i> to perform what is good I do not find. <sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>For the good that I will <i>to do,</i> I do not do; but the evil I will not <i>to do,</i> that I practice. <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>Now if I do what I will not <i>to do,</i> it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.<sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good. <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? '
            'Jeremiah 7:9;': '<h3>Jeremiah 7:9</h3><sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods whom you do not know, '

> “So I say, live by the Holy Spirit’s power. Then you will not do what your desires controlled by sin want you to do” (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 5:16, ">Galatians 5:16, </a>NIrV).

Robert Robinson wrote the hymn “Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing.” It is one of the best-loved hymns of all time. But Robinson was not always a man of faith. His father’s death left him angry. He started drinking and living a life of sin. But one day he heard a sermon by the famous preacher George Whitefield. And then Robinson gave his life to God. He became a Methodist preacher. And he wrote that hymn with these lines, “Prone [likely to do something] to wander, Lord, I feel it. Prone to leave the God I love.”

Later, someone changed Robinson’s song. This person was uncomfortable with the part about the Christian’s heart wandering away from God. So, the words were changed to “Prone to worship, Lord, I feel it. Prone to love the God I serve.”

But Robinson’s words show the truth about the Christian struggle. As believers, we have two sides: the flesh and the Spirit. These two sides war with each other. Our sinful side will always be “prone” to wander from God. But we must be willing to surrender to His Spirit. Then we will no longer be slaves to the desires of our flesh. This message is at the heart of the verses for this week.
