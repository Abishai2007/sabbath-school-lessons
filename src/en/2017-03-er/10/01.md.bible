            'Galatians 4:21–31;': '<h3>Galatians 4:21-31</h3><sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>But he <i>who was</i> of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. <sup class="versenum">27&#xA0;</sup>For it is written:<span class="oblique">&#x201C;Rejoice, O barren,</span><i>You</i> <span class="oblique">who do not bear!</span><span class="oblique">Break forth and shout,</span><span class="oblique">You who are not in labor!</span><span class="oblique">For the desolate has many more children</span><span class="oblique">Than she who has a husband.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">28&#xA0;</sup>Now we, brethren, as Isaac <i>was,</i> are children of promise. <sup class="versenum">29&#xA0;</sup>But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him <i>who was born</i> according to the Spirit, even so <i>it is</i> now. <sup class="versenum">30&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? <span class="oblique">&#x201C;Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">31&#xA0;</sup>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.'
            'Galatians 4:26, ': '<h3>Galatians 4:26</h3><sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. '
            'Genesis 2:2, 3;': '<h3>Genesis 2:2, 3</h3><sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. <h3>Genesis 2: 3</h3><sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.'
            'Genesis 1:28;': '<h3>Genesis 1:28</h3><sup class="versenum">28&#xA0;</sup>Then God blessed them, and God said to them, &#x201C;Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.&#x201D;'
            'Genesis 3:15': '<h3>Genesis 3:15</h3><sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>And I will put enmityBetween you and the woman,And between your seed and her Seed;He shall bruise your head,And you shall bruise His heel.&#x201D;'

Some christians reject the power of the Old Testament. They do not allow it to have any say in their lives. They feel the giving of the law at Sinai does not agree with the gospel. So, they think that the contract given by God to His people at Sinai is outdated.They believeit wasfora timewhen salvation was based on obeying the law. But the Bible shows that the people of that time failed to obey.As a result, some Christians say God made a new contract. They say this new contract is based on Jesus’ mercy, just as the old contract is based on obeying the law.

But salvation never came from obeying the law. From the start, the religion of the Jews was always one of mercy and forgiveness. In Galatia, Paul fought against the belief in salvation by works. This false belief turned people away from the truth and from the Old Testament. The old and new contracts are not symbols of the times when they were given. Instead, they show two different ways of being saved.These ways go back to Cain andAbel.The old contract is a symbol of people who trust in their own works to please God, just as Cain trusted in his own goodness. But the new contract shows the experience of people who trust in God to do all He has promised. In the same way, Abel trusted in God to forgive his sins.
