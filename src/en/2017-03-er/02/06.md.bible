            'Galatians 1:6–9, 11–24': '<h3> <span>Galatians 1:6-9</span></h3><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed.</span></p><h3> <span>Galatians 1:11-24</span></h3><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught <i>it,</i> but <i>it came</i> through the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and <i>tried to</i> destroy it. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother&#x2019;s womb and called <i>me</i> through His grace, </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood, </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those <i>who were</i> apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and remained with him fifteen days. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord&#x2019;s brother. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>(Now <i>concerning</i> the things which I write to you, indeed, before God, I do not lie.)</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Afterward I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which <i>were</i> in Christ. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But they were hearing only, &#x201C;He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which he once <i>tried to</i> destroy.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And they glorified God in me.</span></p>'

_<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 1:11–24">Galatians 1:11–24</a>_

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 1:6–9, 11–24">Galatians 1:6–9, 11–24</a>. The troublemakers in Galatia accuse Paul of writing his gospel to win the praise of others. Suppose Paul wanted others to think well of him. Then what different things might he have said in his letters to get people to praise him?`

Why does Paul say that Gentile believers do not need to be circumcised? Paul’s enemies say it is because Paul wanted to bring as many people into the church as possible. They accuse Paul of caring more about numbers in the church than about the truth. Paul knew that Gentiles might not want to be circumcised. So Paul’s enemies may have thought that was the reason Paul did not require the Gentiles to be circumcised. As a result, Paul is accused of being a people pleaser! Paul answers by pointing his attackers to his strong words in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 1:8, 9">Galatians 1:8, 9</a>. These verses clearly show that Paul’s purpose is not to get others to think well of him. Suppose Paul wanted that. Then he would have answered in a different way.

`Why does Paul say it is impossible to follow Christ and try to please people at the same time?`

`In <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 1:11, 12">Galatians 1:11, 12</a>, Paul says that God gave him his gospel and the power to preach and lead. How do Paul’s words in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 1:23, 24">Galatians 1:23, 24</a> help make his point?`

The set of verses in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 1:13–24">Galatians 1:13–24</a> gives Paul’s life story before he became a Christian. These verses also tell what happened to him when he became a Christian (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 1:15, 16">Galatians 1:15, 16</a>) and after he became one (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 1:16–24">Galatians 1:16–24</a>). Paul argues that the situations surrounding each of these times in his life show it is impossible to say he received his gospel from anyone but God. Paul refuses to let anyone insult his message by doubting where it came from. Paul knows he was chosen to teach. And he is going to do it even if it is hard to do.

`How sure are you that Christ has chosen you to serve Him? How can you know for sure what God has asked you to do? Suppose you know for sure. Why must you still learn to listen to the wise advice of others?`
