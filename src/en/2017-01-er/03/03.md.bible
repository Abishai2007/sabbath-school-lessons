### THE HOLY SPIRIT: WHO HE IS AND WHAT HE DOES
 
(<a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 2:10, 11">1 Corinthians 2:10, 11</a>)

Many Bible verses describe who the Holy Spirit is and what He does. He is shown as doing the same work that God does. The Bible also describes the Holy Spirit as being the same as God in many ways.

`The following verses list special things about the Holy Spirit that are also true about God. What are those things? Compare <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 2:10, 11">1 Corinthians 2:10, 11</a> with <a class="verse" verse="Isaiah 40:13, 14">Isaiah 40:13, 14</a>. Read <a class="verse" verse="Psalm 139:7">Psalm 139:7</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Luke 1:35">Luke 1:35</a>. Compare <a class="verse" verse="Hebrews 9:14">Hebrews 9:14</a> with <a class="verse" verse="1 Timothy 6:16">1 Timothy 6:16</a>. Compare <a class="verse" verse="Romans 15:19">Romans 15:19</a> with <a class="verse" verse="Psalm 104:30">Psalm 104:30</a>.`  

Paul argues that only One who is equal to God can know the deep things of God (<a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 2:10, 11">1 Corinthians 2:10, 11</a>). In other words, no one knows God as well as the Spirit of God. This is because the Spirit of God knows God from the inside. The Holy Spirit knows God in a way that an outsider does not. So, the Holy Spirit is indeed omniscient (all knowing; knowing everything). 

The Spirit can be found wherever God is. There is no place we can run to where the Spirit of God is not. The Holy Spirit is indeed omnipresent (everywhere at once) (compare with <a class="verse" verse="Psalm 139:7">Psalm 139:7</a>). 

The Holy Spirit is said to be “eternal” (<a class="verse" verse="Hebrews 9:14">Hebrews 9:14</a>). In the Bible, how many eternal beings are there? The answer is that only God is eternal (<a class="verse" verse="1 Timothy 6:16">1 Timothy 6:16</a>). Yet, the Spirit is called eternal. So, He must be God. 

The Holy Spirit also is all powerful. In <a class="verse" verse="Luke 1:35">Luke 1:35</a>, the wording “the Holy Spirit” and “the power of the Most High” (NASB) mean the same thing. Here they both refer to a miracle of the highest power, the virgin birth of Jesus. In <a class="verse" verse="Romans 15:19">Romans 15:19</a>, the apostle Paul makes it clear who gave him the power to do his ministry (work done for God). The Holy Spirit gave the apostle the power to do “mighty signs and wonders” (NKJV). Indeed, the Holy Spirit can do divine miracles. 

Jesus also says that “blasphemy against the Spirit” is unforgivable (<a class="verse" verse="Matthew 12:31, 32">Matthew 12:31, 32</a>, NKJV; read also <a class="verse" verse="Mark 3:28, 29">Mark 3:28, 29</a>). This truth makes no sense unless the Spirit is God. 

But perhaps the most amazing work of the Holy Spirit is His ability to change human hearts and minds. The Holy Spirit is the One who makes a new spiritual birth possible (<a class="verse" verse="John 3:5–8">John 3:5–8</a>). And He has the power to do what only God can do.
