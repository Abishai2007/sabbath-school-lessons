            '1 Corinthians 12:14–31': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 12:14-31</span></h3><p> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For in fact the body is not one member but many.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>If the foot should say, &#x201C;Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body,&#x201D; is it therefore not of the body? </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And if the ear should say, &#x201C;Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body,&#x201D; is it therefore not of the body? </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>If the whole body <i>were</i> an eye, where <i>would be</i> the hearing? If the whole <i>were</i> hearing, where <i>would be</i> the smelling? </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He pleased. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And if they were all one member, where <i>would</i> the body <i>be?</i></span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>But now indeed <i>there are</i> many members, yet one body. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And the eye cannot say to the hand, &#x201C;I have no need of you&#x201D;; nor again the head to the feet, &#x201C;I have no need of you.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And those <i>members</i> of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable <i>parts</i> have greater modesty, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>but our presentable <i>parts</i> have no need. But God composed the body, having given greater honor to that <i>part</i> which lacks it, </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>that there should be no schism in the body, but <i>that</i> the members should have the same care for one another. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with <i>it;</i> or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with <i>it.</i></span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup><i>Are</i> all apostles? <i>Are</i> all prophets? <i>Are</i> all teachers? <i>Are</i> all workers of miracles? </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>But earnestly desire the best gifts. And yet I show you a more excellent way.</span></p>'
            '1 Corinthians 12:11': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 12:11</span></h3><p> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.</span></p>'

### GOD IS THE SUPREME GIVER OF THE SPIRITUAL GIFTS

(<a class="verse" verse="Ephesians 4:7">Ephesians 4:7</a>)

We do not decide what gifts we have. The Greek word for the gifts of the Spirit is charismata. This word tells us that the gifts of the Spirit are gifts of grace (mercy and forgiveness). We do not earn them by who we are or by anything we have done. God freely gives them to us out of love. 

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Ephesians 4:7">Ephesians 4:7</a>. We often think of the Holy Spirit as the One who gives spiritual gifts. But the apostle (leader; teacher) Paul also connects Jesus Christ with the giving of the gifts. How is Jesus involved in the giving of the gifts?` 

Paul says the grace of Christ made it possible to give us spiritual gifts. But the Holy Spirit is the one who gives them to church members. We must accept Jesus Christ as our personal Savior. We must believe in Him. Then the Holy Spirit will give us spiritual gifts “just as he decides” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 12:11">1 Corinthians 12:11</a>, NIrV). So, God alone decides what gifts we are to receive. 

Natural ability is not a spiritual gift. Spiritual gifts are not the same as natural talents developed through long and hard study. Many non-Christians are blessed with such God-given talents. In the end, “every good and perfect gift is from God” (<a class="verse" verse="James 1:17">James 1:17</a>, NIrV). God gives us the gifts of His Spirit to bless the lives of others and to build up His church.

`What does Paul tell his readers in <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 12:14–31">1 Corinthians 12:14–31</a> about the giving of the gifts? Why is this truth so important for understanding how spiritual gifts are meant to be used in the church?`

The Holy Spirit is the one who gives us the gifts. He gives them to us according to (in agreement with) His wisdom and desire. He loves us and knows best how we can serve Him. So we do not need to be jealous of others and their gifts. To envy other gifts is a sign of not being grateful toward God for the gifts that we have. It is a sign that we doubt God’s wisdom in the gifts He has given.

`What gifts has God given to members of your church? What message can you take away from the fact that different people have different gifts?`
