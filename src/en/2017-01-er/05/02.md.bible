</span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Him, being delivered by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by lawless hands, have crucified, and put to death; </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>For David says concerning Him:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x2018;I foresaw the L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span> always before my face,</span></span><br><span><span>For He is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken.</span></span><br><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup><span>Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad;</span></span><br><span><span>Moreover my flesh also will rest in hope.</span></span><br><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup><span>For You will not leave my soul in Hades,</span></span><br><span><span>Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.</span></span><br><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup><span>You have made known to me the ways of life;</span></span><br><span><span>You will make me full of joy in Your presence.&#x2019;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Men <i>and</i> brethren, let <i>me</i> speak freely to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, He would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne, </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>he, foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>This Jesus God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses. </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Therefore being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear.</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x2018;The L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span> said to my Lord,</span></span><br><span><span>&#x201C;Sit at My right hand,</span></span><br><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup><span>Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.&#x201D;&#x2019;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>Now when they heard <i>this,</i> they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, &#x201C;Men <i>and</i> brethren, what shall we do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter said to them, &#x201C;Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, &#x201C;Be saved from this perverse generation.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>Then those who gladly received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand souls were added <i>to them.</i> </span> <span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>And they continued steadfastly in the apostles&#x2019; doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers. </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>Then fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles. </span> <span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>Now all who believed were together, and had all things in common, </span> <span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>and sold their possessions and goods, and divided them among all, as anyone had need.</span></p><p><span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, </span> <span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.</span></p>'

### THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

(<a class="verse" verse="Mark 1:8">Mark 1:8</a>)

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Mark 1:8">Mark 1:8</a>. (Compare this verse with <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 3:11">Matthew 3:11</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Luke 3:16">Luke 3:16</a>; and <a class="verse" verse="John 1:33">John 1:33</a>.) Also read <a class="verse" verse="Acts 1:5">Acts 1:5</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Acts 11:16">Acts 11:16</a>. According to these verses, what other important act happens along with the baptism of the Spirit?` 

In the New Testament, there are only seven verses that speak about being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Four of the verses refer to John the Baptist and point to Pentecost. At Pentecost, Christ gave the Holy Spirit to His followers. The gift marked the beginning of “the last days” of salvation history. 

The four Gospels talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit. But the Gospel (book) of John does not describe this baptism in the same way that the Gospel books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke do. For example, John does not speak about the baptism of the Spirit as something that happens only in the future. Instead, he makes it clear that the baptism of the Spirit is an ongoing experience. It has continuing power in the life of the believer (read <a class="verse" verse="John 1:33">John 1:33</a>). 

In the same way, John talks about another important work of Jesus a few verses earlier in <a class="verse" verse="John 1:29">John 1:29</a>. This work of Jesus involves taking away our sins and giving us the Holy Spirit. Both of these experiences happen in <a class="verse" verse="Acts 2:38">Acts 2:38</a>. The disciples’ eyes are opened to Christ. Then they receive both forgiveness of sins and the Holy Spirit. <a class="verse" verse="Acts 10:43, 44">Acts 10:43, 44</a> says that the same experience happens to believers in the house of Cornelius.  

In the New Testament, receiving the Holy Spirit goes together with baptism. Both point to our new birth. This is because in baptism we become Christ’s. Why does Jesus give us the Holy Spirit? He wants us to live in His power. And He wants us to share the good news with others. The good news is that He takes away our sins. 

All believers, then, are meant to drink of the Spirit. In <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>, Paul says that we all are baptized by the Spirit into one body (church) of believers. He talks about the importance of all believers becoming one in heart and in mind. The word all is important. Paul connects the oneness in Christ of all believers with the baptism of the Spirit. 

`What has been your own experience in being baptized (filled) by the Holy Spirit? What has He meant to your life? What would you be like without Him working in you?`
