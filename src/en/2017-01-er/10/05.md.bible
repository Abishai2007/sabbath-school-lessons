            'Luke 8:1–11': '<h3> <span>Luke 8:1-11</span></h3><p><span><span>8&#xA0;</span>Now it came to pass, afterward, that He went through every city and village, preaching and bringing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God. And the twelve <i>were</i> with Him, </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities&#x2014;Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had come seven demons, </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod&#x2019;s steward, and Susanna, and many others who provided for Him from their substance.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And when a great multitude had gathered, and they had come to Him from every city, He spoke by a parable: </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.</span> </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup><span>Some fell on rock; and as soon as it sprang up, it withered away because it lacked moisture.</span> </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup><span>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.</span> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup><span>But others fell on good ground, sprang up, and yielded a crop a hundredfold.&#x201D;</span> When He had said these things He cried, <span>&#x201C;He who has ears to hear, let him hear!&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then His disciples asked Him, saying, &#x201C;What does this parable mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>And He said, <span>&#x201C;To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest <i>it is given</i> in parables, that</span></span></p><p><span><span>&#x2018;Seeing they may not see,</span></span><br><span><span>And hearing they may not understand.&#x2019;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</span> </span> </p>'

            'John 11': '<h3> <span>John 11</span></h3><p><span><span>11&#xA0;</span>Now a certain <i>man</i> was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>It was <i>that</i> Mary who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the sisters sent to Him, saying, &#x201C;Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>When Jesus heard <i>that,</i> He said, <span>&#x201C;This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>So, when He heard that he was sick, He stayed two more days in the place where He was. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Then after this He said to <i>the</i> disciples, <span>&#x201C;Let us go to Judea again.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup><i>The</i> disciples said to Him, &#x201C;Rabbi, lately the Jews sought to stone You, and are You going there again?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Jesus answered, <span>&#x201C;Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</span> </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup><span>But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>These things He said, and after that He said to them, <span>&#x201C;Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Then His disciples said, &#x201C;Lord, if he sleeps he will get well.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>However, Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus said to them plainly, <span>&#x201C;Lazarus is dead.</span> </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup><span>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, that you may believe. Nevertheless let us go to him.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, &#x201C;Let us also go, that we may die with Him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Now Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met Him, but Mary was sitting in the house. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Now Martha said to Jesus, &#x201C;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Your brother will rise again.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Martha said to Him, &#x201C;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live.</span> </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup><span>And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>She said to Him, &#x201C;Yes, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And when she had said these things, she went her way and secretly called Mary her sister, saying, &#x201C;The Teacher has come and is calling for you.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>As soon as she heard <i>that,</i> she arose quickly and came to Him. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met Him. </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, &#x201C;She is going to the tomb to weep there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to Him, &#x201C;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled. </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>And He said, <span>&#x201C;Where have you laid him?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span>They said to Him, &#x201C;Lord, come and see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>Jesus wept. </span> <span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>Then the Jews said, &#x201C;See how He loved him!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>And some of them said, &#x201C;Could not this Man, who opened the eyes of the blind, also have kept this man from dying?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;Take away the stone.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span>Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to Him, &#x201C;Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been <i>dead</i> four days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>Then they took away the stone <i>from the place</i> where the dead man was lying. And Jesus lifted up <i>His</i> eyes and said, <span>&#x201C;Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.</span> </span> <span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup><span>And I know that You always hear Me, but because of the people who are standing by I said <i>this,</i> that they may believe that You sent Me.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>Now when He had said these things, He cried with a loud voice, <span>&#x201C;Lazarus, come forth!&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>And he who had died came out bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;Loose him, and let him go.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in Him. </span> <span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things Jesus did. </span> <span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, &#x201C;What shall we do? For this Man works many signs. </span> <span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>If we let Him alone like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>49&#xA0;</sup>And one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, &#x201C;You know nothing at all, </span> <span><sup>50&#xA0;</sup>nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>51&#xA0;</sup>Now this he did not say on his own <i>authority;</i> but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, </span> <span><sup>52&#xA0;</sup>and not for that nation only, but also that He would gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</span></p><p><span><sup>53&#xA0;</sup>Then, from that day on, they plotted to put Him to death. </span> <span><sup>54&#xA0;</sup>Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there remained with His disciples.</span></p><p><span><sup>55&#xA0;</sup>And the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves. </span> <span><sup>56&#xA0;</sup>Then they sought Jesus, and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple, &#x201C;What do you think&#x2014;that He will not come to the feast?&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>57&#xA0;</sup>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if anyone knew where He was, he should report <i>it,</i> that they might seize Him.</span></p>'

### THE BIBLE TEACHES THAT WE MUST CLAIM GOD’S PROMISES

(<a class="verse" verse="1 John 5:14, 15">1 John 5:14, 15</a>)

We must claim the things that God promises us when we pray. If we do not, then what we believe or how much we believe will make no difference. 

`Read <a class="verse" verse="1 John 5:14, 15">1 John 5:14, 15</a>. These verses say that we can be sure that God hears us. And we can be sure that we have what we ask for from Him. What does John say is the reason we have for trusting these promises?` 

We must ask God for what we need in keeping with what He wants. And we must believe His promises. Then we need to claim what He has promised. We can claim God’s promise by giving thanks to God. But we must thank Him even before we receive what we ask for from Him. In this way, the promises become part of our hearts. They live within us. Ellen G. White said, “We may ask for any gift God promises. Then we are to believe that we receive the promise. And we are to give thanks to God that we have received it.”—Adapted from Education, page 258. 

In <a class="verse" verse="Luke 8:1–11">Luke 8:1–11</a>, Jesus shows how the Word of God is like seed. A whole apple tree, for example, is contained in an apple seed. In the same way, the gift of God is contained in His promise. We must claim the promise. 

<a class="verse" verse="John 11">John 11</a> shows that Jesus prayed in this way. In <a class="verse" verse="John 11:39–41">John 11:39–41</a>, we read that Jesus thanked the Father for bringing Lazarus back to life. But Lazarus was still in the grave. Jesus received the answer to His prayer when He thanked God. We must remember, then, that we are God’s children. We also are to live on God’s promises. 

“The Lord says, ‘Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you.’ <a class="verse" verse="Psalm 50:15">Psalm 50:15</a> [NKJV]. He invites us to bring to Him the things that puzzle us. We are to tell Him our needs. We are to tell Him of our need for divine help. He asks us always to be ready to pray. We are to ask Him for what we need when trouble comes. Our urgent prayers show our strong trust in God. The sense of our need leads us to pray earnestly. Our heavenly Father is moved by our asking.”—Adapted from Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, page 172. 

`Why is it so important to always bring everything to God in prayer?`
