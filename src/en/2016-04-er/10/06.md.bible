            'Job 1–2:10': "<h3>Job 1-2:10</h3><div>\n<h3><span>Job and His Family in Uz</span></h3><p><span><span>1&#xA0;</span>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <i>was</i> Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And seven sons and three daughters were born to him. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East.</span></p> <p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And his sons would go and feast <i>in their</i> houses, each on his <i>appointed</i> day, and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings <i>according to</i> the number of them all. For Job said, &#x201C;It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.&#x201D; Thus Job did regularly.</span></p> <h3><span>Satan Attacks Job&#x2019;s Character</span></h3><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, and Satan also came among them. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;From where do you come?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>So Satan answered the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> and said, &#x201C;From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;Have you considered My servant Job, that <i>there is</i> none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>So Satan answered the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> and said, &#x201C;Does Job fear God for nothing? </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;Behold, all that he has <i>is</i> in your power; only do not lay a hand on his <i>person.</i>&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>So Satan went out from the presence of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>.</span></p> <h3><span>Job Loses His Property and Children</span></h3><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Now there was a day when his sons and daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother&#x2019;s house; </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>and a messenger came to Job and said, &#x201C;The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>when the Sabeans raided <i>them</i> and took them away&#x2014;indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, &#x201C;The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, &#x201C;The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, &#x201C;Your sons and daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother&#x2019;s house, </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell to the ground and worshiped. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And he said:</span></p><div><p><span>&#x201C;Naked I came from my mother&#x2019;s womb,</span><br><span>And naked shall I return there.</span><br><span>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> gave, and the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> has taken away;</span><br><span>Blessed be the name of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>.&#x201D;</span></p></div> <p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong.</span></p> <h3><span>Satan Attacks Job&#x2019;s Health</span></h3><p><span><span>2&#xA0;</span>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;From where do you come?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Satan answered the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> and said, &#x201C;From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;Have you considered My servant Job, that <i>there is</i> none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?

THE CHALLENGE OF FAITH

(Review <a class="verse" verse="Job 1–2:10">Job 1–2:10</a>)

Certainly the main characters in the book of Job are just weak humans who see life “through a glass [mirror], darkly [dimly]” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>). Interesting, too, that in all these debates about the evil that happens to Job, none of the men, Job included, discusses the role of the devil. The devil is the real cause of all of Job’s problems. Job’s friends are very sure about how right they are, especially Elihu (read <a class="verse" verse="Job 36:1–4">Job 36:1–4</a>). But they fail to explain Job’s suffering. And, of course, Job knows that they have failed.

`Even with our understanding of the story’s greatcontroversy background, how well are we able to reason and explain the evil that happens to Job? Read <a class="verse" verse="Job 1–2:10">Job 1–2:10</a> again. Even with all the causes of Job’s suffering shown to us, what other questions remain?`

We know well the opening chapters of Job. And we have a view of things that none of these men in the book of Job have. But even now, the issues remain hard to understand. As we learned, far from anything evil Job had done to bring this suffering upon himself, it is Job’s goodness that causes God to point him out to the devil. So did Job’s goodness and desire to be faithful to God lead to these terrible events happening to him? How do we understand this?

In the end, God wins His challenge with the devil, but we know the devil has not surrendered to defeat (<a class="verse" verse="Revelation 12:12">Revelation 12:12</a>). So what is the purpose of Job’s suffering? And also, whatever good comes out of what happens to Job, is it worth the death of all these people and all the suffering that Job goes through? If these questions remain for us (but more answers are coming), imagine all the questions that Job had!

And here is one of the most important lessons we can learn from the book of Job. We are to live by faith and not by sight. We are to trust in God and stay faithful to Him even when, like Job, we cannot reason or explain why things happen as they do. We do not live by faith when everything can be explained fully. We live by faith when, like Job, we trust and obey God, even when we cannot make sense of what is happening around us.

`What are the things you must trust God for, even though you do not understand them? How can you continue to build that trust, even when you do not have answers?`
