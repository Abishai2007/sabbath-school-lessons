            'Job 1:20–22': "<h3>Job 1:20-22</h3><div>\n<p><span><sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell to the ground and worshiped. </span> <span><sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>And he said:</span></p><div><p><span>&#x201C;Naked I came from my mother&#x2019;s womb,</span><br><span>And naked shall I return there.</span><br><span>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> gave, and the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> has taken away;</span><br><span>Blessed be the name of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>.&#x201D;</span></p></div> <p><span><sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong.</span></p></div>"
            'Job 1': "<h3>Job 1 </h3><div>\n<h3><span>Job and His Family in Uz</span></h3><p><span><span>1&#xA0;</span>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <i>was</i> Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil. </span> <span><sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And seven sons and three daughters were born to him. </span> <span><sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East.</span></p> <p><span><sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>And his sons would go and feast <i>in their</i> houses, each on his <i>appointed</i> day, and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. </span> <span><sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings <i>according to</i> the number of them all.

```After Satan’s first attack on Job, after the news came to him about all the calamities that befell him, how did Job respond? (See <a class="verse" verse="Job 1:20–22">Job 1:20–22</a>.) What is the significance of the fact that, even amid such tragedy, Job “sinned not, nor charged God foolishly”?```

Central to God’s government, a government based on love, is free- dom of choice. God wants us to serve Him because we love Him, not because we are forced to serve Him. “Satan insinuated that Job served God from selfish motives. . . . He attempted to deny that true religion springs from love and an intelligent appreciation of God’s character, that true worshipers love religion for its own sake—not for reward; that they serve God because such service is right in itself, and not merely because heaven is full of glory; and that they love God because He is worthy of their affection and confidence, and not merely because He blesses them.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 500.

In the book of Job, Job proved Satan’s charges wrong. However, though God knew what would happen, Job still could have acted dif- ferently. He could have sinned, he could have “charged God foolishly.” God did not force Job to act as he did. Job’s steadfast faithfulness, considering the circumstances, was an amazing testimony before men and angels.

```Compare what happened in <a class="verse" verse="Job 1">Job 1</a> to what happened with Adam and Eve in <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 3:1–8">Genesis 3:1–8</a>. How does the contrast make their sin appear so terrible?```

Adam and Eve, sinless beings amid a true paradise, transgressed and fell into sin because of Satan’s attack; Job, amid utter pain and tragedy and ruin, stayed faithful to the Lord despite Satan’s attacks. In both cases, we have a powerful example of the great issues at stake in regard to free will.
    
How does Job’s reaction here show us how cheap, easy, and false our excuses for sin can often be?
