```Read <a class="verse" verse="Romans 3:1–4">Romans 3:1–4</a>. Though the immediate context is the unfaithful- ness of some of God’s covenant people, what is the bigger issue that Paul is talking about here? What is Paul saying about God?```

Quoting <a class="verse" verse="Psalm 51:4">Psalm 51:4</a>, Paul talks about how the Lord Himself will “be justified in your words and will prevail when you are judged” (<a class="verse" verse="Rom 3:4">Rom. 3:4</a>, NET). The idea being presented is a motif that appears in various places in the Scriptures. It’s called theodicy, and it is the question of understanding the goodness of God in the face of evil. It’s the age-old question that we have been looking at all week. In fact, the whole great controversy itself is really a theodicy. Before humans, before angels, before the whole universe, the goodness of God will be revealed despite the evil that unfolds in the world.

“Every question of truth and error in the long-standing controversy has now been made plain. The results of rebellion, the fruits of setting aside the divine statutes, have been laid open to the view of all cre- ated intelligences. The working out of Satan’s rule in contrast with the government of God has been presented to the whole universe. Satan’s own works have condemned him. God’s wisdom, His justice, and His goodness stand fully vindicated. It is seen that all His dealings in the great controversy have been conducted with respect to the eternal good of His people and the good of all the worlds that He has created.” —Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, pp. 670, 671.

However hard it might be for us now to understand, immersed as we are in a world of sin and suffering (and if it’s hard for us, imagine what Job must have thought), when it is all over we will be able to see the goodness and justice and love and fairness of God in all His dealings with humanity, with Satan, and with sin. This doesn’t mean that every- thing that happens in the world is good; clearly it’s not. It means only that God is dealing with it in the best way possible, and then when this terrible experience with sin is over, we will be able to shout: “ ‘Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints!’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Rev 15:3">Rev. 15:3</a>, NKJV).

```Why is it so important to be praising God, even now, even amid the trials that seem so hard to bear?```
