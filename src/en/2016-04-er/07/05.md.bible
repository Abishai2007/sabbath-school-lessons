And are you seeking the priesthood also? </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Therefore you and all your company <i>are</i> gathered together against the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>. And what <i>is</i> Aaron that you complain against him?&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, but they said, &#x201C;We will not come up! </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup><i>Is it</i> a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you should keep acting like a prince over us? </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Moreover you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Then Moses was very angry, and said to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, &#x201C;Do not respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, nor have I hurt one of them.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And Moses said to Korah, &#x201C;Tomorrow, you and all your company be present before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>&#x2014;you and they, as well as Aaron. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Let each take his censer and put incense in it, and each of you bring his censer before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, two hundred and fifty censers; both you and Aaron, each <i>with</i> his censer.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>So every man took his censer, put fire in it, laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the tabernacle of meeting with Moses and Aaron. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And Korah gathered all the congregation against them at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.

Touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>So they got away from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little children.</span></p> <p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And Moses said: &#x201C;By this you shall know that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> has sent me to do all these works, for <i>I have</i> not <i>done them</i> of my own will. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>If these men die naturally like all men, or if they are visited by the common fate of all men, <i>then</i> the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> has not sent me. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>But if the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> creates a new thing, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the pit, then you will understand that these men have rejected the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Now it came to pass, as he finished speaking all these words, that the ground split apart under them, </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and all the men with Korah, with all <i>their</i> goods. </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>So they and all those with them went down alive into the pit; the earth closed over them, and they perished from among the assembly. </span></p></div>"

### If the Lord Creates a New Thing

#### (<a class="verse" verse="Numbers 16:28–30">Numbers 16:28–30</a>)

Many examples of direct punishment by God upon evil are written in the Bible. Many blessings for faithfulness are written there too. These were written long after all the characters in the book of Job were dead. 

`In <a class="verse" verse="Deuteronomy 6:24, 25">Deuteronomy 6:24, 25</a>, what great promise is given for obedience?` 

The Old Testament is filled with promise after promise of the blessings and rewards that God would directly bring to His people if they were to obey Him. So we can find here examples of what these men had said to Job about how God blesses the faithfulness of those who seek6 to obey Him and His commandments. Those who seek to live a godly and upright life also are blessed. 

Of course, the Old Testament also is filled with warnings about God’s just punishment for those who disobey. In the Old Testament, God made a covenant (promise) with Israel at Sinai. Afterward, God warned the Israelites about what would happen if they disobeyed Him. “ ‘But you must not disobey him [God]. You must not say no to his commands. If you do, his powerful hand will punish you. That’s [that is] what happened to your people who lived before you’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Samuel 12:15">1 Samuel 12:15</a>, NIrV).

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Numbers 16:1–33">Numbers 16:1–33</a>. What does this event teach about how real God’s just punishment is?`

The rebels were destroyed. Their punishment was terrible. So it does not make sense to believe in the idea of “sin bringing its own punishment.” These people faced just punishment from God for their sin and rebellion (war against God). In this case, we find unusual examples of God’s power. It seems that the very laws of nature themselves were changed. “ ‘But the Lord will make something totally new happen. The ground will open its mouth and swallow them up. It will swallow up everything that belongs to them. They will go down into the grave alive. When that happens, you will know that those men have made fun of the Lord’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Numbers 16:30">Numbers 16:30</a>, NIrV). 

Here, the verb “make” (“creates” [NKJV]) is from the same root word used for “created” in <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</a>. The Lord wants everyone to know that it is He Himself who quickly and directly brings this punishment upon the rebels.

*The Lord Himself quickly and directly brought this punishment upon the rebels.*
