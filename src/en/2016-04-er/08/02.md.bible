Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>?&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>So when Moses heard <i>it,</i> he fell on his face; </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>and he spoke to Korah and all his company, saying, &#x201C;Tomorrow morning the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> will show who <i>is</i> His and <i>who is</i> holy, and will cause <i>him</i> to come near to Him. That one whom He chooses He will cause to come near to Him. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Do this: Take censers, Korah and all your company; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>put fire in them and put incense in them before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> tomorrow, and it shall be <i>that</i> the man whom the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> chooses <i>is</i> the holy one. <i>You take</i> too much upon yourselves, you sons of Levi!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then Moses said to Korah, &#x201C;Hear now, you sons of Levi: </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup><i>Is it</i> a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the work of the tabernacle of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, and to stand before the congregation to serve them; </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>and that He has brought you near <i>to Himself,</i> you and all your brethren, the sons of Levi, with you? And are you seeking the priesthood also? </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Therefore you and all your company <i>are</i> gathered together against the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>. And what <i>is</i> Aaron that you complain against him?&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, but they said, &#x201C;We will not come up! </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup><i>Is it</i> a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you should keep acting like a prince over us? </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Moreover you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Then Moses was very angry, and said to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, &#x201C;Do not respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, nor have I hurt one of them.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And Moses said to Korah, &#x201C;Tomorrow, you and all your company be present before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>&#x2014;you and they, as well as Aaron. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Let each take his censer and put incense in it, and each of you bring his censer before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, two hundred and fifty censers; both you and Aaron, each <i>with</i> his censer.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>So every man took his censer, put fire in it, laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the tabernacle of meeting with Moses and Aaron. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And Korah gathered all the congregation against them at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. Then the glory of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> appeared to all the congregation.</span></p> <p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Then they fell on their faces, and said, &#x201C;O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and You be angry with all the congregation?&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>So the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Speak to the congregation, saying, &#x2018;Get away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And he spoke to the congregation, saying, &#x201C;Depart now from the tents of these wicked men! Touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>So they got away from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little children.</span></p> <p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And Moses said: &#x201C;By this you shall know that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> has sent me to do all these works, for <i>I have</i> not <i>done them</i> of my own will. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>If these men die naturally like all men, or if they are visited by the common fate of all men, <i>then</i> the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> has not sent me. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>But if the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> creates a new thing, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the pit, then you will understand that these men have rejected the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Now it came to pass, as he finished speaking all these words, that the ground split apart under them, </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and all the men with Korah, with all <i>their</i> goods. </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>So they and all those with them went down alive into the pit; the earth closed over them, and they perished from among the assembly. </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Then all Israel who <i>were</i> around them fled at their cry, for they said, &#x201C;Lest the earth swallow us up <i>also!</i>&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>And a fire came out from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering incense.</span></p> <p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying: </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Tell Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to pick up the censers out of the blaze, for they are holy, and scatter the fire some distance away. </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>The censers of these men who sinned against their own souls, let them be made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar. Because they presented them before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned up had presented, and they were hammered out as a covering on the altar, </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup><i>to be</i> a memorial to the children of Israel that no outsider, who <i>is</i> not a descendant of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, that he might not become like Korah and his companions, just as the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> had said to him through Moses.</span></p></div>"

### JOB’S COMPLAINT

<a class="verse" verse="Job 10">Job 10</a>

Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar have a point: God does punish evil. But that point does not apply in Job’s situation. Job’s suffering is not caused by God’s just (fair) punishment. God is not punishing Job for his sins, as He would do with Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.3 And Job is not reaping what he had sown. No, Job is a righteous (holy) man, and God Himself says so (read <a class="verse" verse="Job 1:8">Job 1:8</a>). So Job does not deserve what has happened to him, and he knows that he does not deserve it. That is what makes Job’s complaints so hard and bitter.

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Job 10">Job 10</a>. What is Job saying to God? And why does it make so much sense when you think about Job’s situation?`

In times of great suffering, have not those who believed in God asked the same questions? Why, Lord, did You bother to create me at all? Or, Why are You doing this to me? Or, Would it not have been better if I had never been born than to have been created and faced this?

Again, what makes it all the harder for Job to understand is that he knows that he has been faithful to God. He cries out to Him: “ ‘You already know I’m [I am] not guilty. No one can save me from your powerful hand’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Job 10:7">Job 10:7</a>, NIrV).

There is a difficult puzzle here: his friends may say differently, but Job is not suffering because of his sin. The book itself teaches the opposite: Job is suffering here just because he is so faithful. The  rst two chapters of the book make that point. Job has no way of knowing what the cause of his suffering is. And if he did, it probably would have made his bitterness and frustration worse.

Job’s situation is rather special. But it is also universal4 in that it is dealing with the question of suffering, a suffering that seems so much greater than whatever evil someone might have done.

`What can you say to someone who believes that he or she is suffering unfairly?`

##### Definitions
3. **Korah, Dathan, and Abiram**— three men who rebelled against Moses. So God punished them by opening up the ground under their feet. See <a class="verse" verse="Numbers 16:1–40">Numbers 16:1–40</a> for details.
4. **universal**—done or experienced by everyone.
