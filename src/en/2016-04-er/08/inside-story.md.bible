            'Exodus 20': "<h3>Exodus 20 </h3><div>\n<h3><span>The Ten Commandments</span></h3><p><span><span>20&#xA0;</span>And God spoke all these words, saying:</span></p> <div><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;I <i>am</i> the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</span></p> <p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall have no other gods before Me.</span></p> <p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall not make for yourself a carved image&#x2014;any likeness <i>of anything</i> that <i>is</i> in heaven above, or that <i>is</i> in the earth beneath, or that <i>is</i> in the water under the earth; </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> your God, <i>am</i> a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth <i>generations</i> of those who hate Me, </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.</span></p> <p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall not take the name of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> your God in vain, for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> will not hold <i>him</i> guiltless who takes His name in vain.</span></p> <p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Six days you shall labor and do all your work, </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>but the seventh day <i>is</i> the Sabbath of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> your God. <i>In it</i> you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who <i>is</i> within your gates. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>For <i>in</i> six days the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that <i>is</i> in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.</span></p> <p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you.</span></p> <p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall not murder.</span></p> <p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall not commit adultery.</span></p> <p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall not steal.</span></p> <p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.</span></p> <p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall not covet your neighbor&#x2019;s house; you shall not covet your neighbor&#x2019;s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that <i>is</i> your neighbor&#x2019;s.&#x201D;</span></p></div> <h3><span>The People Afraid of God&#x2019;s Presence</span></h3><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Now all the people witnessed the thunderings, the lightning flashes, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw <i>it,</i> they trembled and stood afar off. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Then they said to Moses, &#x201C;You speak with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>And Moses said to the people, &#x201C;Do not fear; for God has come to test you, and that His fear may be before you, so that you may not sin.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>So the people stood afar off, but Moses drew near the thick darkness where God <i>was.</i></span></p> <h3><span>The Law of the Altar</span></h3><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#x201C;Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: &#x2018;You have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>You shall not make <i>anything to be</i> with Me&#x2014;gods of silver or gods of gold you shall not make for yourselves. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>An altar of earth you shall make for Me, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I record My name I will come to you, and I will bless you. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>And if you make Me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone; for if you use your tool on it, you have profaned it. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>Nor shall you go up by steps to My altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed on it.&#x2019;</span></p></div>"

### The Devil’s Lies: Part 1

Rui lived with his grandparents in Portugal. When he was 7 years old, his grandparents died. Rui wanted to know what happened to people when they died, but his uncle, with whom he’d gone to live, didn’t have the answers.

Rui began a long search for answers. He started by attending a Sunday School near his uncle’s home. Hoping to find answers to his spiritual questions there, he often recited the prayers he had memorized, but he couldn’t seem to bridge the gap between himself and God.

Rui bought a Bible, hoping it would help him to understand God. But because he had been taught that common people can’t understand it, he placed it on a shelf of honor and didn’t read it.

Then one day he moved the Bible to clean the shelf. The Bible flipped open to <a class="verse" verse="Exodus 20">Exodus 20</a>. Rui noticed that the page heading said “The Ten Commandments.” He sat down and read the chapter. He had memorized the Ten Commandments in church, but he was startled to find that the commandments in the Bible differed from those he had memorized.

That Sunday he asked the priest why the commandments he had learned in church differed from those in the Bible. He was disappointed when the priest simply told him to follow the commandments of the church and ignore the Bible version. Rui’s frustration grew. He stopped attending the church, but the emptiness in his life remained.

Rui remembered hearing his relatives say that his grandmother used to speak to spirits. Rui wondered whether he had the same ability. Feeling frustrated because he couldn’t find the answers to his spiritual questions in church, he decided to seek the answers from the dead.

He went to meetings to call on the spirits and soon began to sense a spiritual presence with him. Soon he was deeply involved in the spirit world. He found a book on witchcraft and began studying it. But some of the instructions were so horrifying that he destroyed everything he had that related to the spirits. He kept only his Bible.

Rui again began searching for answers about God. He attended several churches and asked many questions. But what they told him left him confused and frustrated.
