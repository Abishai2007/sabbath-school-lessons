            'Leviticus 19:18': '<h3> <span>Leviticus 19:18</span></h3><p> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p>'
            '1 Pet 2:13–17': '<h3> <span>1 Peter 2:13-17</span></h3><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord&#x2019;s sake, whether to the king as supreme, </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and <i>for the</i> praise of those who do good. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of God. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Honor all <i>people.</i> Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</span></p>'
            'Matthew 22:39': '<h3> <span>Matthew 22:39</span></h3><p> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup><span>And <i>the</i> second <i>is</i> like it: &#x2018;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#x2019;</span> </span> </p>'
            'Rom 13:1–10': '<h3> <span>Romans 13:1-10</span></h3><p><span><span>13&#xA0;</span>Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>For he is God&#x2019;s minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God&#x2019;s minister, an avenger to <i>execute</i> wrath on him who practices evil. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Therefore <i>you</i> must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience&#x2019; sake. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are God&#x2019;s ministers attending continually to this very thing. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes <i>are due,</i> customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>For the commandments, <span>&#x201C;You shall not commit adultery,&#x201D; &#x201C;You shall not murder,&#x201D; &#x201C;You shall not steal,&#x201D; &#x201C;You shall not bear false witness,&#x201D;</span> <span>&#x201C;You shall not covet,&#x201D;</span> and if <i>there is</i> any other commandment, are <i>all</i> summed up in this saying, namely, <span>&#x201C;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love <i>is</i> the fulfillment of the law.</span></p>'
            'Acts 5:27–32': '<h3> <span>Acts 5:27-32</span></h3><p> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>And when they had brought them, they set <i>them</i> before the council. And the high priest asked them, </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x201C;Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name? And look, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this Man&#x2019;s blood on us!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>But Peter and the <i>other</i> apostles answered and said: &#x201C;We ought to obey God rather than men. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a tree. </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Him God has exalted to His right hand <i>to be</i> Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And we are His witnesses to these things, and <i>so</i> also <i>is</i> the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him.&#x201D;</span></p>'
            'Acts 4:5–23': '<h3> <span>Acts 4:5-23</span></h3><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And it came to pass, on the next day, that their rulers, elders, and scribes, </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>as well as Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the family of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, &#x201C;By what power or by what name have you done this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, &#x201C;Rulers of the people and elders of Israel: </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>If we this day are judged for a good deed <i>done</i> to a helpless man, by what means he has been made well, </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands here before you whole. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>This is the <span>&#x2018;stone which was rejected by you builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled. And they realized that they had been with Jesus. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x201C;What shall we do to these men? For, indeed, that a notable miracle has been done through them <i>is</i> evident to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny <i>it.</i> </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>But so that it spreads no further among the people, let us severely threaten them, that from now on they speak to no man in this name.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>So they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>But Peter and John answered and said to them, &#x201C;Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way of punishing them, because of the people, since they all glorified God for what had been done. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>For the man was over forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And being let go, they went to their own <i>companions</i> and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. </span> </p>'
            'Acts 4:1–4': '<h3> <span>Acts 4:1-4</span></h3><p><span><span>4&#xA0;</span>Now as they spoke to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came upon them, </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>being greatly disturbed that they taught the people and preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And they laid hands on them, and put <i>them</i> in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>However, many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.</span></p>'
            'Acts 5:28': '<h3> <span>Acts 5:28</span></h3><p> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x201C;Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name? And look, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this Man&#x2019;s blood on us!&#x201D;</span></p>'

### Christianity and the Social Order 

Despite knowing that human organizations and governments are flawed and sometimes sinful, and despite their bad experiences with governments and religious leaders, both Paul and Peter urged early Christians to submit to human authorities (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:13–17">1 Pet. 2:13–17</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Rom 13:1–10">Rom. 13:1–10</a>). Christians, they say, should pay taxes and contribute to compulsory labor obligations. As far as possible, Christians were to be model citizens. 

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Acts 5:27–32">Acts 5:27–32</a>. What is the relationship between the obedience that Peter says to render to the authorities (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:13–17">1 Pet. 2:13–17</a>) and what Peter and the other apostles actually did in this one incident?`

The early successes of the Christian church led to the arrest of Peter and John (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 4:1–4">Acts 4:1–4</a>). They had been questioned by the rulers, elders, and scribes, and then let go with a stern warning that they should desist from preaching (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 4:5–23">Acts 4:5–23</a>). Soon afterward they were arrested again and asked why they had not followed what the authorities told them to do (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 5:28">Acts 5:28</a>). Peter replied, “We ought to obey God rather than men” (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 5:29">Acts 5:29</a>).

`What crucial truth must we take from these words?`

Peter was not being a hypocrite, saying one thing and doing another. When it became an issue of following God or following human beings, the choice was clear. Until then, Christians should be supportive and obedient to government, even if they also work to try to bring about positions of social change. When moral issues are at stake, Christians have been and still should be involved in legally promoting the kind of social changes that reflect the values and teachings of Jesus. How this should be done depends upon many factors, but being a loyal and faithful citizen doesn’t automatically mean that a Christian can’t or shouldn’t seek to help improve society.  

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Leviticus 19:18">Leviticus 19:18</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 22:39">Matthew 22:39</a>. How might the command to love our neighbor as ourselves include the need to work for change when that change could indeed make life better and fairer for your neighbor?`
