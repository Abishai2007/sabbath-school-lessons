        verses:
            '1 Pet 2:13–23': '<h3> <span>1 Peter 2:13-23</span></h3><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord&#x2019;s sake, whether to the king as supreme, </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and <i>for the</i> praise of those who do good. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of God. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Honor all <i>people.</i> Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Servants, <i>be</i> submissive to <i>your</i> masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For this <i>is</i> commendable, if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering wrongfully. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>For what credit <i>is it</i> if, when you are beaten for your faults, you take it patiently? But when you do good and suffer, if you take it patiently, this <i>is</i> commendable before God. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;Who committed no sin,</span></span><br><span><span>Nor was deceit found in His mouth&#x201D;</span>; </span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed <i>Himself</i> to Him who judges righteously; </span> </p>'
            '1 Cor 7:12–16': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 7:12-16</span></h3><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is willing to live with him, let him not divorce her. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And a woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is willing to live with her, let her not divorce him. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such <i>cases.</i> But God has called us to peace. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save <i>your</i> husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save <i>your</i> wife?</span></p>'
            '1 Pet 2:21–24': '<h3> <span>1 Peter 2:21-24</span></h3><p> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;Who committed no sin,</span></span><br><span><span>Nor was deceit found in His mouth&#x201D;</span>; </span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed <i>Himself</i> to Him who judges righteously; </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness&#x2014;by whose stripes you were healed. </span> </p>'
            'Gal 3:27, 28': '<h3> <span>Galatians 3:27</span></h3><p> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. </span> </p><h3> <span>Galatians 3:28</span></h3><p> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. </span> </p>'
            '1 Pet 3:1–7': '<h3> <span>1 Peter 3:1-7</span></h3><p><span><span>3&#xA0;</span>Wives, likewise, <i>be</i> submissive to your own husbands, that even if some do not obey the word, they, without a word, may be won by the conduct of their wives, </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>when they observe your chaste conduct <i>accompanied</i> by fear. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Do not let your adornment be <i>merely</i> outward&#x2014;arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on <i>fine</i> apparel&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>rather <i>let it be</i> the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible <i>beauty</i> of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, being submissive to their own husbands, </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose daughters you are if you do good and are not afraid with any terror.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Husbands, likewise, dwell with <i>them</i> with understanding, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as <i>being</i> heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.</span></p>'
            'Acts 5:27–32': '<h3> <span>Acts 5:27-32</span></h3><p> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>And when they had brought them, they set <i>them</i> before the council. And the high priest asked them, </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x201C;Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name? And look, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this Man&#x2019;s blood on us!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>But Peter and the <i>other</i> apostles answered and said: &#x201C;We ought to obey God rather than men. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a tree. </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Him God has exalted to His right hand <i>to be</i> Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And we are His witnesses to these things, and <i>so</i> also <i>is</i> the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him.&#x201D;</span></p>'
            '1 Peter 4:8': '<h3> <span>1 Peter 4:8</span></h3><p> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And above all things have fervent love for one another, for <span>&#x201C;love will cover a multitude of sins.&#x201D;</span> </span> </p>'
            'Lev 19:18': '<h3> <span>Leviticus 19:18</span></h3><p> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p>'

> “Above all things have fervent love for one another, for ‘love will cover a multitude of sins’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 4:8">1 Peter 4:8</a>, NKJV). 

Peter’s letter also tackles head-on some of the difficult social questions of his time. For instance, how should Christians live with an oppressive and corrupt government, such as what most of them experienced then: the pagan Roman Empire? What did Peter tell his readers, and what do his words mean to us today? 

How should Christian slaves react when their masters treat them harshly and unjustly? Though modern employer-employee relationships are different from that of a first-century master-slave relationship, what Peter says will no doubt resonate with those who have to deal with unreasonable bosses. How fascinating that Peter points to Jesus and how He responded to bad treatment as the example of how Christians should conduct themselves when faced with the same (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:21–24">1 Pet. 2:21–24</a>). 

How should husbands and wives interact with each other, especially when they differ on a matter as fundamental as religious belief ?

Finally, how should Christians relate to the social order when, in fact, the social and/or political order might be decidedly corrupt and contrary to Christian faith?
