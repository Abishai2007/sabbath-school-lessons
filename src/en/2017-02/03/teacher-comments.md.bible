### _The Lesson in Brief_

**Key Texts**: <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1; 1 Pet 2:4; 1 Pet 2:5; 1 Pet 2:9; 1 Pet 2:10">1 Pet 1; 1 Pet 2:4; 1 Pet 2:5; 1 Pet 2:9; 1 Pet 2:10</a>; 

#### **The Student Will:**
- **Know:** Understand the high calling that he or she has in belonging to the covenant people of God.
- **Feel:** Appreciate the special status to which God has called His covenant community—“a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:9">1 Pet. 2:9</a>, NIV).
- **Do:** Choose to fulfill the purposes for which God has called His people.

#### **Learning Outline:**
1. Know: A Royal Priesthood, a Holy Nation 
   + **A** What does it mean to be living stones in a spiritual house built upon a chosen and precious Cornerstone that is the living Stone?
   + **B** What is implied by the expression “a royal priesthood, a holy nation” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:9">1 Pet. 2:9</a>, NIV)?
2. Feel: Identification With Christ’s Community
   + **A** How does it feel to be hewn from the same quarry (compare with <a class="verse" verse="Isa 51:1">Isa. 51:1</a>) and built into the same house as the Cornerstone?
   + **B** How do we behave once we realize that we are cut from the same quarry?
3. Do: Declare His Praises.
   + **A** How does Peter describe the purposes for which God has called His covenant people?
   + **B** In what ways are we fulfilling the purposes for which God has called us to Himself?
 
**Summary:** Peter cites several Old Testament passages to remind his readers of their special status before God as members of God’s new covenant community in continuity with the Old Testament covenant community and built upon the same foundation—the Messiah.

#### **Learning Cycle**
------

#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 2:4, 5">1 Peter 2:4, 5</a>

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: We gain our spiritual identity from Christ, the living Stone, a chosen and precious Cornerstone. As living stones dug from the same quarry (<a class="verse" verse="Isa 51:1">Isa. 51:1</a>), we are being built into a spiritual house for the purpose of offering up as a holy priesthood spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus. In mercy, God chose us for Himself to be a royal priesthood and a holy nation that we may declare the praises of Him who called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. This statement of covenant is reminiscent of <a class="verse" verse="Exodus 19:5, 6">Exodus 19:5, 6</a>, creating a continuity between the Old Testament covenant people of God and His New Testament covenant people.

**Just for Teachers**: It is very important to give attention in this section to Peter’s quotations of, and allusions to, the Old Testament. Peter draws, respectively, on <a class="verse" verse="Isaiah 28:16">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Psalm 118:22">Psalm 118:22</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Isaiah 8:14">Isaiah 8:14</a>; and <a class="verse" verse="Exodus 19:5, 6">Exodus 19:5, 6</a>. Study these passages and Peter’s use of them to teach truths that his readers need to understand. How does Jesus use the stone passages to refer to Himself as the rejected Messiah? (See <a class="verse" verse="Matt 21:42">Matt. 21:42</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Mark 12:10">Mark 12:10</a>, and <a class="verse" verse="Luke 20:17">Luke 20:17</a>.) How did Peter use the same idea in <a class="verse" verse="Acts 4:11">Acts 4:11</a>? What use did Paul make of this idea in <a class="verse" verse="Ephesians 2:20">Ephesians 2:20</a>? What allusions to <a class="verse" verse="Exodus 19:5, 6">Exodus 19:5, 6</a> seem to be made in <a class="verse" verse="Rev 1:6; Rev 5:10; Rev 20:6">Rev 1:6; Rev 5:10; Rev 20:6</a>; ?

**Opening Activity and Discussion**: Have the class read together <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 2:4–6">1 Peter 2:4–6</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Isaiah 51:1">Isaiah 51:1</a>. Discuss the implied relation between the living Stone, who is the chosen and precious Cornerstone, and the living stones that are being built together into a spiritual house so that they might offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.


#### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**:

Consider the transition that takes place between verses 1–3 and verses 4, 5 of <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 2">1 Peter 2</a>. Verses 1–3 conclude the previous section, which speaks of a new birth “through the living and enduring word of God” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:23">1 Pet. 1:23</a>, NIV). Peter’s readers are charged, “like newborn babies,” to “crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation, now that you have tasted that the Lord is good” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:2, 3">1 Pet. 2:2, 3</a>, NIV).
 
The metaphor changes, however, as Peter moves into the next section, in <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 2:4, 5">1 Peter 2:4, 5</a>. Suddenly Peter’s readers are no longer babies but are living stones being built together into a spiritual house. They are also a holy priesthood offering up spiritual sacrifices to God. The latter metaphor continues in <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 2:9">1 Peter 2:9</a> as the believers are described as “a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession” (NIV), building on the covenant language of the Old Testament.

### **Bible Commentary**

**I. Babies Craving Pure Spiritual Milk** (Review <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 2:1–3">1 Peter 2:1–3</a> with your class.)

Peter charges those who have been born again through the Word of God (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:23">1 Pet. 1:23</a>) and have tasted that the Lord is good (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:3">1 Pet. 2:3</a>) to crave, as newborn babies, pure spiritual milk that will produce spiritual growth in them. A parallel with <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 3:18">2 Peter 3:18</a> may suggest that the pure spiritual milk is a knowledge of Jesus Christ as Lord and reception of His grace. (Peter’s charge here to crave pure spiritual milk should not be viewed as being in conflict with Paul’s criticism, in <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 3:1, 2">1 Corinthians 3:1, 2</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Hebrews 5:12–14">Hebrews 5:12–14</a>, of those who failed to move on to solid food as they grew. Peter is speaking in the context of the new birth.)

**Consider This**: What characteristics of spiritual maturity identified by Peter do I manifest in my own spiritual life? How can I make the study of God’s Word a priority for myself?

**II. Living Stones Built Into a Spiritual House** (Review <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 2:4, 5">1 Peter 2:4, 5</a> with your class.)

Peter begins this section with the words, “As you come to him, the living Stone” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:4">1 Pet. 2:4</a>, NIV), referring to the Lord in verse 3. This forms the pretext for “you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house.” One cannot be built into a spiritual house without coming to the Lord Jesus Christ. Just as He is the living Stone, we are to be “like living stones” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:5">1 Pet. 2:5</a>, NIV), as He is, as if hewn from the same quarry (<a class="verse" verse="Isa 51:1">Isa. 51:1</a>). He is the chosen and precious Cornerstone (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:6">1 Pet. 2:6</a>) of the spiritual house into which we are being built. The cornerstone is the stone from which the rest of the building is measured, plumbed, and squared. The believers are also “to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:5">1 Pet. 2:5</a>, NIV). Regarding which spiritual sacrifices are acceptable to God, see <a class="verse" verse="Psalm 4:5; 51:17; 107:22">Psalm 4:5; 51:17; 107:22</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Romans 12:1">Romans 12:1</a>; and <a class="verse" verse="Hebrews 13:15, 16">Hebrews 13:15, 16</a>.

**Consider This**: In what ways am I being built into a spiritual house for God? What spiritual sacrifices am I offering to God as one belonging to a holy priesthood?

**III. A People Chosen by and for God** (Review <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 2:9–12">1 Peter 2:9–12</a> with your class.)

In Scripture, God chooses and calls; people respond. Those who respond positively are called the chosen or elect. Jesus said, “ ‘Many are called, but few are chosen’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 22:14">Matt. 22:14</a>, NKJV). The fact that Peter calls his readers “a chosen people” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:9">1 Pet. 2:9</a>, NIV) suggests that they have responded to God’s call and have entered into covenant relationship with Him. 

“A royal priesthood, a holy nation” refers to <a class="verse" verse="Exodus 19:5, 6">Exodus 19:5, 6</a>, in which God tells Israel that if they keep His covenant, they will be for Him “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” This declaration does not mean that all will be priests, capable of serving in the presence of God in the temple. It means that His people will be expected, as “a holy priesthood” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:5">1 Pet. 2:5</a>, NKJV), to offer up spiritual sacrifices such as praise, joy, righteous deeds, and service to others (see <a class="verse" verse="Heb 13:15, 16">Heb. 13:15, 16</a>). 

Thus, Peter declares, believers were chosen so that they “may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:9">1 Pet. 2:9</a>, NIV). The possibility of believers rendering such service is because of God’s great mercy and grace in choosing them (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:10">1 Pet. 2:10</a>, NIV). The gift of His merciful grace in the soul results in living godly lives before the world, to His glory (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:11, 12">1 Pet. 2:11, 12</a>).

**Discussion Questions**: 

1. What clues might we have as to how much we do or do not crave pure spiritual milk? 
2. What evidence might be adduced that we are being built as living stones into a spiritual house?
3. What spiritual sacrifices are we, as members of a holy priesthood, offering to God day by day? How are we glorifying Him who called us from darkness into light?

**Consider This**: Here Peter links the church with ancient Israel, God’s covenant people. In what ways do I sense a connection with historical Israel? With my own Adventist roots?

#### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: In The Desire of Ages, Ellen G. White provides some significant historical background to the image of the cornerstone. An actual occurrence in the history of the building of Solomon’s temple lay behind Isaiah’s prophecy. A large stone of unusual size and peculiar shape had been prepared for the cornerstone, but when it was brought to the building site, the workmen rejected it. Other stones were selected instead, but each failed to meet the demands of weather and pressure. Finally, the rejected stone was brought back. It met all of the demands placed upon it. It turned out to be an exact fit and was finally accepted as the cornerstone of the temple. “In prophetic vision, Isaiah was shown that this stone was a symbol of Christ.”—Page 598.

**Thought Questions**: 

1. In what ways do I demonstrate that I am a living stone being built up into a spiritual house? 
2. What does it mean for me to be part of a royal priesthood and a holy nation?
3. How do I keep from stumbling on the living Stone, the precious Cornerstone?

**Activity**: Take time for class members to express praise to God for having called them out of darkness into His wonderful light.

#### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: It may be helpful for the class to become familiar with the tools and methods of a stonemason. Building with stone always begins at a base corner. It is critical for the first stone to be properly squared horizontally and vertically, as every other stone takes its alignment from the cornerstone. Strings are stretched vertically along the top edge of the cornerstone after it is set true with a level. A plumb bob at the corner provides a true vertical line. A tape measure determines the distance of the horizontal and vertical lines. Originally, large stones called ashlars were cut at the quarry and were set on one another without mortar. Their size and weight held them in place, sometimes with molten lead poured into adjoining notches on top to lock them into place once fitted.

**Activity**: Compare the metaphor for the church as a growing building in <a class="verse" verse="Ephesians 2:19–22">Ephesians 2:19–22</a> with the metaphor for the church as a growing body in <a class="verse" verse="Ephesians 4:12–16">Ephesians 4:12–16</a>. Discuss how members need to adapt themselves to the respective structure for effective growth in each metaphor. How do living stones adapt themselves?
