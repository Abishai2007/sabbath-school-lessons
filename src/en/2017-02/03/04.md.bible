            'Gen 15:9–21, 17:1–26': '<h3> <span>Genesis 15:9-21</span></h3><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>So He said to him, &#x201C;Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, down the middle, and placed each piece opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds in two. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And when the vultures came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, horror <i>and</i> great darkness fell upon him. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Then He said to Abram: &#x201C;Know certainly that your descendants will be strangers in a land <i>that is</i> not theirs, and will serve them, and they will afflict them four hundred years. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And also the nation whom they serve I will judge; afterward they shall come out with great possessions. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Now as for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried at a good old age. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>But in the fourth generation they shall return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites <i>is</i> not yet complete.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>And it came to pass, when the sun went down and it was dark, that behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a burning torch that passed between those pieces. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>On the same day the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> made a covenant with Abram, saying:</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;To your descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the River Euphrates&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>the Kenites, the Kenezzites, the Kadmonites, </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.&#x201D;</span></p><h3> <span>Genesis 17:1-26</span></h3><p><span><span>17&#xA0;</span>When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to Abram and said to him, &#x201C;I <i>am</i> Almighty God; walk before Me and be blameless. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And I will make My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying: </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of many nations. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you a father of many nations. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Also I give to you and your descendants after you the land in which you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>And God said to Abraham: &#x201C;As for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>This <i>is</i> My covenant which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: Every male child among you shall be circumcised; </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>and you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and you. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised, every male child in your generations, he who is born in your house or bought with money from any foreigner who is not your descendant. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised, and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And the uncircumcised male child, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Then God said to Abraham, &#x201C;As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah <i>shall be</i> her name. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And I will bless her and also give you a son by her; then I will bless her, and she shall be <i>a mother of</i> nations; kings of peoples shall be from her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, &#x201C;Shall <i>a child</i> be born to a man who is one hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear <i>a child?</i>&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>And Abraham said to God, &#x201C;Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Then God said: &#x201C;No, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, <i>and</i> with his descendants after him. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall beget twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this set time next year.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Then He finished talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>So Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham&#x2019;s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very same day, as God had said to him. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Abraham <i>was</i> ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>And Ishmael his son <i>was</i> thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>That very same day Abraham was circumcised, and his son Ishmael; </span> </p>'
            'Exod 19:1–24:8': '<h3> <span>Exodus 19:1-24:8</span></h3><p><span><span>19&#xA0;</span>In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came <i>to</i> the Wilderness of Sinai. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>For they had departed from Rephidim, had come <i>to</i> the Wilderness of Sinai, and camped in the wilderness. So Israel camped there before the mountain.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And Moses went up to God, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> called to him from the mountain, saying, &#x201C;Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>&#x2018;You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and <i>how</i> I bore you on eagles&#x2019; wings and brought you to Myself. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth <i>is</i> Mine. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#x2019; These <i>are</i> the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>So Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before them all these words which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> commanded him. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then all the people answered together and said, &#x201C;All that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has spoken we will do.&#x201D; So Moses brought back the words of the people to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#x201C;Behold, I come to you in the thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you forever.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>So Moses told the words of the people to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#x201C;Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And let them be ready for the third day. For on the third day the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will come down upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>You shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, &#x2018;Take heed to yourselves <i>that</i> you do <i>not</i> go up to the mountain or touch its base. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Not a hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot <i>with an arrow;</i> whether man or beast, he shall not live.&#x2019; When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come near the mountain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And he said to the people, &#x201C;Be ready for the third day; do not come near <i>your</i> wives.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Then it came to pass on the third day, in the morning, that there were thunderings and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain; and the sound of the trumpet was very loud, so that all the people who <i>were</i> in the camp trembled. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Now Mount Sinai <i>was</i> completely in smoke, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> descended upon it in fire. Its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And when the blast of the trumpet sounded long and became louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by voice. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain. And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#x201C;Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to gaze at the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and many of them perish. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Also let the priests who come near the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> consecrate themselves, lest the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> break out against them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But Moses said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, &#x201C;The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai; for You warned us, saying, &#x2018;Set bounds around the mountain and consecrate it.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, &#x201C;Away! Get down and then come up, you and Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, lest He break out against them.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.</span></p><p><span><span>20&#xA0;</span>And God spoke all these words, saying:</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall have no other gods before Me.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall not make for yourself a carved image&#x2014;any likeness <i>of anything</i> that <i>is</i> in heaven above, or that <i>is</i> in the earth beneath, or that <i>is</i> in the water under the earth; </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God, <i>am</i> a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth <i>generations</i> of those who hate Me, </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall not take the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God in vain, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will not hold <i>him</i> guiltless who takes His name in vain.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Six days you shall labor and do all your work, </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>but the seventh day <i>is</i> the Sabbath of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God. <i>In it</i> you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who <i>is</i> within your gates. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>For <i>in</i> six days the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that <i>is</i> in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God is giving you.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall not murder.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall not commit adultery.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall not steal.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You shall not covet your neighbor&#x2019;s house; you shall not covet your neighbor&#x2019;s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that <i>is</i> your neighbor&#x2019;s.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Now all the people witnessed the thunderings, the lightning flashes, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw <i>it,</i> they trembled and stood afar off. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Then they said to Moses, &#x201C;You speak with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>And Moses said to the people, &#x201C;Do not fear; for God has come to test you, and that His fear may be before you, so that you may not sin.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>So the people stood afar off, but Moses drew near the thick darkness where God <i>was.</i></span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#x201C;Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: &#x2018;You have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>You shall not make <i>anything to be</i> with Me&#x2014;gods of silver or gods of gold you shall not make for yourselves. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>An altar of earth you shall make for Me, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I record My name I will come to you, and I will bless you. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>And if you make Me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone; for if you use your tool on it, you have profaned it. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>Nor shall you go up by steps to My altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed on it.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span><span>21&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Now these <i>are</i> the judgments which you shall set before them: </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years; and in the seventh he shall go out free and pay nothing. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>If he comes in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he <i>comes in</i> married, then his wife shall go out with him. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>If his master has given him a wife, and she has borne him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master&#x2019;s, and he shall go out by himself. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>But if the servant plainly says, &#x2018;I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,&#x2019; </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>then his master shall bring him to the judges. He shall also bring him to the door, or to the doorpost, and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him forever.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;And if a man sells his daughter to be a female slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>If she does not please her master, who has betrothed her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed.

### God’s Covenant People 

Peter is writing very much from an Old Testament perspective. And central to this perspective is the idea of covenant, a theme central to Jewish and Christian theology.

What is the covenant? 

Covenant (Hebrew, berit) is a word that describes a treaty or formal agreement between two parties. It could be made between two individuals (for example, Laban and Jacob in <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 31:44">Genesis 31:44</a>) or between two kings (for example, Solomon and Hiram in <a class="verse" verse="1 Kings 5:12">1 Kings 5:12</a>, where berit is translated as “league” in the KJV and “treaty” in the NRSV). It could also be made between a king and his people, such as David and the elders of Israel (<a class="verse" verse="2 Sam 5:3">2 Sam. 5:3</a>). 

Prominent among these themes is the special covenant relationship that exists between God and His chosen people, the descendants of Abraham.  

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 17:1–4">Genesis 17:1–4</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Exodus 2:24">Exodus 2:24</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Exodus 24:3–8">Exodus 24:3–8</a>. What do these texts tell us about the covenant God made with Israel?`

The first book of the Bible, Genesis, recounts how God made a covenant with Abraham (<a class="verse" verse="Gen 15:9–21, 17:1–26">Gen. 15:9–21, 17:1–26</a>). God “remembered” this covenant when He rescued His people from oppression in Egypt (<a class="verse" verse="Exod 2:24">Exod. 2:24</a>). God renewed it at the time of Moses, when He gave the Ten Commandments and other laws to the children of Israel (<a class="verse" verse="Exod 19:1–24:8">Exod. 19:1–24:8</a>; especially <a class="verse" verse="Exod 24:3–8">Exod. 24:3–8</a>). 

But the covenant promises were not unconditional. “The Lord covenanted that if they were faithful in the observance of His requirements, He would bless them in all their increase and in all the work of their hands.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, p. 574. Indeed, the prophets repeatedly warned Israel of the dangers of disobedience to God’s law, often using language reminiscent of the covenant. It has been argued that with the possible exception of the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation, many prophecies in the Bible are conditional. That’s how central the idea of obedience is in regard to the covenant promises. The covenantal prophecies of blessing were conditional on obedience to God’s law, and prophecies of doom applied only to the disobedient. 

`What does it mean to you to be in a covenant relationship with God? What obligations does this covenant relationship place on you?`
