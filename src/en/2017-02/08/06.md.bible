They have a heart trained in covetous practices, <i>and are</i> accursed children. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the <i>son</i> of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>but he was rebuked for his iniquity: a dumb donkey speaking with a man&#x2019;s voice restrained the madness of the prophet.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>These are wells without water, clouds carried by a tempest, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For when they speak great swelling <i>words</i> of emptiness, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through lewdness, the ones who have actually escaped from those who live in error. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the latter end is worse for them than the beginning. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known <i>it,</i> to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: <span>&#x201C;A dog returns to his own vomit,&#x201D;</span> and, &#x201C;a sow, having washed, to her wallowing in the mire.&#x201D;</span></p><h3> <span>2 Peter 1:8</span></h3><p> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>For if these things are yours and abound, <i>you</i> will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. </span> </p><h3> <span>2 Peter 1:14</span></h3><p> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>knowing that shortly I <i>must</i> put off my tent, just as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me. </span> </p><h3> <span>2 Peter 1:16</span></h3><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>For we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty. </span> </p>'

### Jesus, the Divine Messiah 

Peter knew not only that Jesus was the Messiah but that He was the Lord, as well. That is, by the time of these epistles, Peter knew that the Messiah was God Himself. Though the title “Lord” can have a secular meaning, the term also can be a clear reference to divinity. In <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 1:3">1 Peter 1:3</a> and <a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2; 2 Pet 1:8; 2 Pet 1:14; 2 Pet 1:16">2 Pet 2; 2 Pet 1:8; 2 Pet 1:14; 2 Pet 1:16</a>; , Peter is referring to Jesus, the Messiah, the Christ, as the Lord, as God Himself. 

Like other writers in the New Testament, Peter describes the relationship between Jesus and God with the words Father and Son. For example, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</a>, NKJV; compare <a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 1:17">2 Pet. 1:17</a>). Jesus is described as the beloved Son (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 1:17">2 Pet. 1:17</a>), and some of Jesus’ authority as Lord, and His heavenly status, comes from this special relationship that He has with God the Father. 

`Read <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 1:1">2 Peter 1:1</a>, <a class="verse" verse="John 1:1">John 1:1</a>, and <a class="verse" verse="John 20:28">John 20:28</a>. What do these texts tell us about the divinity of Jesus?`

Second Peter 1:1 says “our God and Savior Jesus Christ” (NKJV). In the Greek original, the same definite article (that is, “the”) is used for both God and Savior. Grammatically this means that both “God” and “Savior” are used of Jesus. Second Peter 1:1, then, stands as one of the very clear indications in the New Testament of the full divinity of Jesus. 

As the early Christians struggled to understand Jesus, they gradually put the evidence of the New Testament together. In the writings of Peter, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are distinct (for example, Father/Son: <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:3">1 Pet. 1:3</a>, <a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 1:17">2 Pet. 1:17</a>; Holy Spirit: <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:12">1 Pet. 1:12</a>, <a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 1:21">2 Pet. 1:21</a>), as indeed they are in the rest of the New Testament. Yet, at the same time, Jesus is portrayed as fully divine, as is the Holy Spirit. Over time, and after much discussion, the church developed the doctrine of the Trinity to explain as well as possible the divine mystery of the Godhead. Seventh-day Adventists include the doctrine of the Trinity as one of their 28 fundamental beliefs. Thus, we see in Peter a clear depiction of Jesus, not only as the Messiah but as God Himself. 

`When you think about the life and death of Jesus and then realize that He was God, what does this tell you about the kind of God we serve and why we should love and trust Him? Bring your answer to class on Sabbath.`
