### Living the Life of Salvation

`Read <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 1:13–21">1 Peter 1:13–21</a>. According to this passage, what should motivate Christian behavior?`

The word therefore, which begins <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 1:13">1 Peter 1:13</a>, NKJV, shows that what Peter will say next grows out of what he had just said. As we saw in yesterday’s study, Peter just had been talking about the grace of God and the hope that Christians have in Jesus Christ (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:3–12">1 Pet. 1:3–12</a>). 

As a result of this grace and hope, Peter urges his readers to “gird up the loins of your mind” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:13">1 Pet. 1:13</a>). That is, as a response to the salvation that they have in Jesus, they must prepare their minds in order to stand firm and be faithful (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:13">1 Pet. 1:13</a>). 

`Read <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 1:13">1 Peter 1:13</a>. What does it mean to rest your hope fully upon the grace revealed in Jesus?`

No question, Peter tells them their hope rests only in Jesus. But he then emphasizes that a certain level of behavior is expected from Christians as a consequence of their salvation. He notes three of the great motivations that lie behind Christian behavior: the character of God (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:15, 16">1 Pet. 1:15, 16</a>), the coming judgment (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:17">1 Pet. 1:17</a>), and the cost of redemption (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:17–21">1 Pet. 1:17–21</a>).

The first thing that will motivate Christian behavior is the character of God. This character can be summed up this way: God is holy. Peter quotes from <a class="verse" verse="Leviticus 11:44, 45">Leviticus 11:44, 45</a> when he says, “Be ye holy; for I am holy” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:16">1 Pet. 1:16</a>). Therefore those who follow Jesus must also be holy (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:15–17">1 Pet. 1:15–17</a>).

A second motivation for Christian behavior is found in the realization that God, who is holy, will judge everyone impartially, according to what each has done (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:17">1 Pet. 1:17</a>).

A third motivation arises from the great truth that Christians are redeemed. This means that they have been bought with a price, a very high price: the precious blood of Christ (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:19">1 Pet. 1:19</a>). Peter emphasizes that the death of Jesus was not an accident of history but something established before the foundation of the world (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:20">1 Pet. 1:20</a>).

`What motivates you to be a Christian? What would you answer, and why, if someone asked you, Why are you a Christian? Bring your answers to class on Sabbath.`
