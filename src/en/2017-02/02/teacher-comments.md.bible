#### **Learning Cycle**

#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 1:3–5">1 Peter 1:3–5</a>

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**:

Through God’s mercy, we have received a new birth, leading to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. This hope promises us an imperishable, undefiled, and unfading inheritance. God has reserved it in heaven for us who have been preserved by His power through faith for a salvation that is soon to be revealed at Christ’s return. We find great joy in this hope, even when we experience various trials. The development of our characters in and through these trials will result in praise, glory, and honor to God when Christ is revealed.

**Just for Teachers**: It seems evident that Peter writes in <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 1:1">1 Peter 1:1</a> to people who are scattered through the provinces of Asia Minor, either as a result of persecution or through purposeful resettlement by the Roman authorities. In either case, they would have been dispossessed of their homes and have felt like aliens among strange peoples. Such people need hope in an inheritance that is enduring. Peter offers such hope to his readers.

**Opening Activity and Discussion**: Have the class read <a class="verse" verse="Psalm 64">Psalm 64</a>. Discuss the setting in which this psalm of David is apparently written and how Peter’s readers might have identified with David’s sense of isolation and desire for hope and salvation from God. Encourage the class members to recall times they may have felt similar disenfranchisement from their communities and a desire for hope in God and His salvation. What Bible promises have provided hope and joy at such times?

#### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**:

Commentator Karen H. Jobes argues rather convincingly in favor of a program of Roman colonization under Emperor Claudius as a plausible explanation for Peter’s description of his addressees as “strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:1">1 Pet. 1:1</a>). “The entire book of 1 Peter is both framed [<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:1">1 Pet. 1:1</a>; compare with <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 5:13">1 Pet. 5:13</a>] and saturated with the terms of exile and foreignness.”—1 Peter, Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), p. 39. If this theory is correct, the believers whom Peter addresses may not have had Roman citizenship to protect them from what was most likely coerced exile and disenfranchisement in the interest of populating the emperor’s newly established colonies in Asia Minor. Peter’s description of their state as having been “chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father” and “birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:2, 3">1 Pet. 1:2, 3</a>, NIV) points them to God’s ultimate purpose for their situation. They are to live as foreigners and strangers in the earth, for their inheritance is “reserved in heaven for you . . . a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:4, 5">1 Pet. 1:4, 5</a>, NASB).

### **Bible Commentary**

1. **Chosen by God’s Foreknowledge** (Review <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 1:1, 2">1 Peter 1:1, 2</a> with your class.)

Peter addresses the recipients of his first letter by reminding them that although they are aliens in the provinces where they are currently residing, God has selected them according to His divine foreknowledge. They have been set apart by the Spirit of God for a special purpose, namely, for obedience and for being sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ. The latter seems to be an allusion to the establishment of the Mosaic covenant in which the people pledged obedience to the covenant. The covenant was then ratified by sprinkling the blood of the sacrifice on the people (see <a class="verse" verse="Exod 24:3–8">Exod. 24:3–8</a>). Peter then expresses for his readers a wish for grace and peace to be with them in full measure.

**Consider This**: In what ways might we be considered aliens in this world? (See <a class="verse" verse="Heb 11:9; Heb 11:10; Heb 11:13; Heb 11:16">Heb. 11:9; Heb. 11:10; Heb. 11:13; Heb. 11:16</a>; .) How do we demonstrate our calling and status by our lifestyles?

2. **Begotten Again to a Living Hope** (Review <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 1:3–9">1 Peter 1:3–9</a> with your class.)

New life begins with a new conception. This life comes from God’s mercy for undeserving sinners. The result for the believer is a living hope, which derives from Jesus’ own resurrection from the dead. This hope is grounded in an inheritance that is reserved in heaven for those who are protected by God’s power through faith. It climaxes in a salvation that is ready to be revealed at the return of Christ on the last day. Such a hope produces great joy in the believer despite various trials that put faith to the test, and it will result in praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. Indescribable joy is the experience of all who will attain the goal of their faith: the salvation of their souls.

**Consider This**: How may I experience the hope and joy of one who has been born again? What are the evidences of this in my life?

3. **The Gospel Proclaimed by the Prophets** (Review together <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 1:10–12">1 Peter 1:10–12</a>.)

The Old Testament prophets predicted the grace that would come to Peter’s readers by the suffering of Jesus Christ and His subsequent glorification at His resurrection and ascension. They would have liked to understand these matters better themselves, but they were informed that in their prophetic ministry they were serving not themselves but the believers represented by Peter’s readers who would come afterward. So, the good news that they proclaimed was not fully understood by them—or even by angels. But now that Christ has come, the gospel of grace is more fully grasped by Peter’s readers than it ever was by the prophets, despite the fact that they had the Spirit of Christ in them (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:11">1 Pet. 1:11</a>).

**Consider This**: How does this proclamation of grace apply to us, Peter’s readers, today? How may we understand Peter’s words to apply even more to our situations today than to his own day?

4. **The Call to Holy Living** (Review <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 1:13–25">1 Peter 1:13–25</a> with your class.)

Peter’s readers have been ransomed by the precious blood of Jesus from the empty way of life they inherited from their ancestors. In view of this fact, Peter appeals to them to prepare their minds for action by being fully sober and setting their hopes completely on the grace that will be brought to them at the revelation (visible return) of Jesus Christ. They are called to be holy in all of their conduct, because God, who called them, is holy. They need to live in conscious awareness of the coming judgment, with due respect for the Father, who judges impartially according to each one’s work (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:17">1 Pet. 1:17</a>). This consciousness implies that they will show sincere mutual love out of a pure heart, because they have been born again through the living and enduring Word of God.

Ellen G. White observes, “God has commanded us, ‘Be ye holy; for I am holy;’ and an inspired apostle declares that without holiness ‘no man shall see the Lord.’ Holiness is agreement with God. By sin the image of God in man has been marred and well-nigh obliterated; it is the work of the gospel to restore that which has been lost; and we are to cooperate with the divine agency in this work.”—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 743.

**Discussion Questions**: 

1. Unless one has something to live for in the future, what motivates one’s present course of action? 
2. What value does Peter place on the inheritance he holds out before his readers?
3. What value does Peter place on the readers themselves, based on the price paid for their redemption? What obligation does this price, in turn, place upon Peter’s readers?

#### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Remind the class of the experiences of other biblical characters—such as Abraham, Joseph, David, and Daniel—who went through the experience of being foreigners in a strange land and who learned to rely on the promises of God for an inheritance that yet lay in the future. Have the class read together <a class="verse" verse="Hebrews 11:8–10, 13–16">Hebrews 11:8–10, 13–16</a>, and discuss the attitude that instilled faith and hope in the patriarchs. Compare our own situation, as alluded to in <a class="verse" verse="Hebrews 11:39, 40">Hebrews 11:39, 40</a>.

**Thought Questions**: 

1. What is the essence of the gospel announced by the Old Testament prophets and proclaimed by the Holy Spirit? 
2. What are some of the ways in which you are conscious of the price paid to ransom us from our empty ways of life? What difference does this knowledge make in how we live?
3. In what ways do we experience the joy of our salvation on a daily basis?

**Activity**: Take a few minutes to share testimonies regarding the hope that class members experience as a result of having found the joy of salvation in Christ.

#### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: Many find it difficult to know how to witness to others of the hope and joy of salvation. First, one needs to experience that hope and joy in a meaningful way. It may be helpful to practice sharing with one another before attempting to share with strangers. The Sabbath School class is an opportunity to practice sharing until one is comfortable knowing what to do and say.

**Activity**: Provide opportunity for class members to gain experience in witnessing for their faith by creating a role-playing situation in which members witness to one another as if to people in the community. Begin with experienced members, modeling witnessing activities; then encourage others to emulate their examples until they gain confidence.
