### The Word in Our Lives 

As we have seen, Peter placed great emphasis on the Holy Scriptures. Second Peter 1:19–21 is a powerful affirmation of the importance of the Bible to our Christian experience and to the divine inspiration of the Scriptures. His point is clear in <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 1:21">2 Peter 1:21</a>. The Bible is not the product of human will, human devising, like other books. It is a book produced through the power of the Holy Spirit working through “holy men of God.”

`Read <a class="verse" verse="2 Timothy 3:15–17">2 Timothy 3:15–17</a>. How do these texts help us to understand the role of Scripture in our lives? How do they enforce the truth of <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 1:19–21">2 Peter 1:19–21</a>?`

After warning Timothy about the dangers facing him and the church, Paul gives a brief outline of the importance of Scripture. “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Tim 3:16">2 Tim. 3:16</a>). 

Let’s look at these three points.

Doctrine: Doctrines are the teachings of the church. They express the beliefs of the community on various biblical topics deemed important in the Word of God. Ideally, each doctrine should be Christ-centered, and each should teach us something that helps us know how to live in accordance with the “perfect will of God” (<a class="verse" verse="Rom 12:2">Rom. 12:2</a>, ASV).

Guidance: Paul tells Timothy that Scripture is profitable for “reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Tim 3:16">2 Tim. 3:16</a>). Peter makes a similar point when he says that the prophecy in Scripture is like a lamp that is shining in a dark place (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 1:19">2 Pet. 1:19</a>). In other words, Scripture provides guidance in how we should live and in what is right and wrong conduct. Inspired by the Holy Spirit, Scripture is nothing less than the revealed will of God.

“Wise unto salvation”: When he says that Scripture makes us “wise unto salvation” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Tim 3:15">2 Tim. 3:15</a>), Paul is pointing out that Scripture points us to Jesus. Salvation is built on the belief that Jesus has died for our sins. 

Doctrine, moral guidance, the knowledge of salvation: no wonder the Word of God is like “a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 1:19">2 Pet. 1:19</a>, NKJV).
