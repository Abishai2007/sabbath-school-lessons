            '1 Tim 5:17': '<h3> <span>1 Timothy 5:17</span></h3><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and doctrine. </span> </p>'
            '1 Pet 5:2': '<h3> <span>1 Peter 5:2</span></h3><p> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but willingly, not for dishonest gain but eagerly; </span> </p>'

            'Acts 14:23': '<h3> <span>Acts 14:23</span></h3><p> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>So when they had appointed elders in every church, and prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed. </span> </p>'
            'Acts 15:6': '<h3> <span>Acts 15:6</span></h3><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Now the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter. </span> </p>'
            'Acts 1–5': '<h3> <span>Acts 1-5</span></h3><p><span><span>1&#xA0;</span>The former account I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>until the day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen, </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And being assembled together with <i>them,</i> He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, <span>&#x201C;which,&#x201D;</span> <i>He said,</i> <span>&#x201C;you have heard from Me;</span> </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup><span>for John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, &#x201C;Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And He said to them, <span>&#x201C;It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority.</span> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup><span>But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me</span><span> in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>who also said, &#x201C;Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This <i>same</i> Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day&#x2019;s journey. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And when they had entered, they went up into the upper room where they were staying: Peter, James, John, and Andrew; Philip and Thomas; Bartholomew and Matthew; James <i>the son</i> of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot; and Judas <i>the son</i> of James. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Men <i>and</i> brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>(Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;For it is written in the Book of Psalms:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x2018;Let his dwelling place be desolate,</span></span><br><span><span>And let no one live in it&#x2019;</span>;</span></p><p><span>and,</span></p><p><span><span>&#x2018;Let</span> <span>another take his office.&#x2019;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>beginning from the baptism of John to that day when He was taken up from us, one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And they proposed two: Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And they prayed and said, &#x201C;You, O Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which of these two You have chosen </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And they cast their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span></p><p><span><span>2&#xA0;</span>When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and <i>one</i> sat upon each of them. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, &#x201C;Look, are not all these who speak Galileans? </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And how <i>is it that</i> we hear, each in our own language in which we were born? </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Parthians and Medes and Elamites, those dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya adjoining Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Cretans and Arabs&#x2014;we hear them speaking in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>So they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, &#x201C;Whatever could this mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Others mocking said, &#x201C;They are full of new wine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said to them, &#x201C;Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and heed my words. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For these are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is <i>only</i> the third hour of the day. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>But this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x2018;And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God,</span></span><br><span><span>That I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh;</span></span><br><span><span>Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,</span></span><br><span><span>Your young men shall see visions,</span></span><br><span><span>Your old men shall dream dreams.</span></span><br><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup><span>And on My menservants and on My maidservants</span></span><br><span><span>I will pour out My Spirit in those days;</span></span><br><span><span>And they shall prophesy.</span></span><br><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup><span>I will show wonders in heaven above</span></span><br><span><span>And signs in the earth beneath:</span></span><br><span><span>Blood and fire and vapor of smoke.</span></span><br><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup><span>The sun shall be turned into darkness,</span></span><br><span><span>And the moon into blood,</span></span><br><span><span>Before the coming of the great and awesome day of the L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span>.</span></span><br><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup><span>And it shall come to pass</span></span><br><span><i>That</i> <span>whoever calls on the name of the L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span></span></span><br><span><span>Shall be saved.&#x2019;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man attested by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Him, being delivered by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by lawless hands, have crucified, and put to death; </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>For David says concerning Him:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x2018;I foresaw the L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span> always before my face,</span></span><br><span><span>For He is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken.</span></span><br><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup><span>Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad;</span></span><br><span><span>Moreover my flesh also will rest in hope.</span></span><br><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup><span>For You will not leave my soul in Hades,</span></span><br><span><span>Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.</span></span><br><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup><span>You have made known to me the ways of life;</span></span><br><span><span>You will make me full of joy in Your presence.&#x2019;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Men <i>and</i> brethren, let <i>me</i> speak freely to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, He would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne, </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>he, foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>This Jesus God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses. </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Therefore being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear.</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x2018;The L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span> said to my Lord,</span></span><br><span><span>&#x201C;Sit at My right hand,</span></span><br><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup><span>Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.&#x201D;&#x2019;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>Now when they heard <i>this,</i> they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, &#x201C;Men <i>and</i> brethren, what shall we do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter said to them, &#x201C;Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, &#x201C;Be saved from this perverse generation.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>Then those who gladly received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand souls were added <i>to them.</i> </span> <span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>And they continued steadfastly in the apostles&#x2019; doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers. </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>Then fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles. </span> <span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>Now all who believed were together, and had all things in common, </span> <span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>and sold their possessions and goods, and divided them among all, as anyone had need.</span></p><p><span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, </span> <span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.</span></p><p><span><span>3&#xA0;</span>Now Peter and John went up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth <i>hour.</i> </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And a certain man lame from his mother&#x2019;s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms from those who entered the temple; </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked for alms. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And fixing his eyes on him, with John, Peter said, &#x201C;Look at us.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>So he gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter said, &#x201C;Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And he took him by the right hand and lifted <i>him</i> up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>So he, leaping up, stood and walked and entered the temple with them&#x2014;walking, leaping, and praising God. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>And all the people saw him walking and praising God. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Then they knew that it was he who sat begging alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Now as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch which is called Solomon&#x2019;s, greatly amazed. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>So when Peter saw <i>it,</i> he responded to the people: &#x201C;Men of Israel, why do you marvel at this? Or why look so intently at us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk? </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let <i>Him</i> go. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>and killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which <i>comes</i> through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Yet now, brethren, I know that you did <i>it</i> in ignorance, as <i>did</i> also your rulers. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But those things which God foretold by the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>and that He may send Jesus Christ, who was preached to you before, </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>For Moses truly said to the fathers, <span>&#x2018;The L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span> your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brethren. Him you shall hear in all things, whatever He says to you.</span> </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup><span>And it shall be</span> <i>that</i> <span>every soul who will not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Yes, and all the prophets, from Samuel and those who follow, as many as have spoken, have also foretold these days. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>You are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, <span>&#x2018;And in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>To you first, God, having raised up His Servant Jesus, sent Him to bless you, in turning away every one <i>of you</i> from your iniquities.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><span>4&#xA0;</span>Now as they spoke to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came upon them, </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>being greatly disturbed that they taught the people and preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And they laid hands on them, and put <i>them</i> in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>However, many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And it came to pass, on the next day, that their rulers, elders, and scribes, </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>as well as Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the family of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, &#x201C;By what power or by what name have you done this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, &#x201C;Rulers of the people and elders of Israel: </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>If we this day are judged for a good deed <i>done</i> to a helpless man, by what means he has been made well, </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands here before you whole. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>This is the <span>&#x2018;stone which was rejected by you builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled. And they realized that they had been with Jesus. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x201C;What shall we do to these men? For, indeed, that a notable miracle has been done through them <i>is</i> evident to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny <i>it.</i> </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>But so that it spreads no further among the people, let us severely threaten them, that from now on they speak to no man in this name.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>So they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>But Peter and John answered and said to them, &#x201C;Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way of punishing them, because of the people, since they all glorified God for what had been done. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>For the man was over forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And being let go, they went to their own <i>companions</i> and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>So when they heard that, they raised their voice to God with one accord and said: &#x201C;Lord, You <i>are</i> God, who made heaven and earth and the sea, and all that is in them, </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>who by the mouth of Your servant David have said:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x2018;Why did the nations rage,</span></span><br><span><span>And the people plot vain things?</span></span><br><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup><span>The kings of the earth took their stand,</span></span><br><span><span>And the rulers were gathered together</span></span><br><span><span>Against the L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span> and against His Christ.&#x2019;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;For truly against Your holy Servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose determined before to be done. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Now, Lord, look on their threats, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your word, </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>by stretching out Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of Your holy Servant Jesus.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul; neither did anyone say that any of the things he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common. </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>And with great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And great grace was upon them all. </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Nor was there anyone among them who lacked; for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold, </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>and laid <i>them</i> at the apostles&#x2019; feet; and they distributed to each as anyone had need.</span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>And Joses, who was also named Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated Son of Encouragement), a Levite of the country of Cyprus, </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>having land, sold <i>it,</i> and brought the money and laid <i>it</i> at the apostles&#x2019; feet.</span></p><p><span><span>5&#xA0;</span>But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And he kept back <i>part</i> of the proceeds, his wife also being aware <i>of it,</i> and brought a certain part and laid <i>it</i> at the apostles&#x2019; feet. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>But Peter said, &#x201C;Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back <i>part</i> of the price of the land for yourself? </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your own control? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Then Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and breathed his last. So great fear came upon all those who heard these things. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And the young men arose and wrapped him up, carried <i>him</i> out, and buried <i>him.</i></span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Now it was about three hours later when his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And Peter answered her, &#x201C;Tell me whether you sold the land for so much?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She said, &#x201C;Yes, for so much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter said to her, &#x201C;How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband <i>are</i> at the door, and they will carry you out.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Then immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. And the young men came in and found her dead, and carrying <i>her</i> out, buried <i>her</i> by her husband. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>So great fear came upon all the church and upon all who heard these things.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. And they were all with one accord in Solomon&#x2019;s Porch. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Yet none of the rest dared join them, but the people esteemed them highly. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And believers were increasingly added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women, </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>so that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid <i>them</i> on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might fall on some of them. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Also a multitude gathered from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Then the high priest rose up, and all those who <i>were</i> with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with indignation, </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said, </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And when they heard <i>that,</i> they entered the temple early in the morning and taught. But the high priest and those with him came and called the council together, with all the elders of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But when the officers came and did not find them in the prison, they returned and reported, </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x201C;Indeed we found the prison shut securely, and the guards standing outside before the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside!&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these things, they wondered what the outcome would be. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>So one came and told them, saying, &#x201C;Look, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>Then the captain went with the officers and brought them without violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned. </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>And when they had brought them, they set <i>them</i> before the council. And the high priest asked them, </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x201C;Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name? And look, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this Man&#x2019;s blood on us!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>But Peter and the <i>other</i> apostles answered and said: &#x201C;We ought to obey God rather than men. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a tree. </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Him God has exalted to His right hand <i>to be</i> Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And we are His witnesses to these things, and <i>so</i> also <i>is</i> the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>When they heard <i>this,</i> they were furious and plotted to kill them. </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in respect by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while. </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>And he said to them: &#x201C;Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men. </span> <span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing. </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed. </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this work is of men, it will come to nothing; </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>but if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it&#x2014;lest you even be found to fight against God.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>And they agreed with him, and when they had called for the apostles and beaten <i>them,</i> they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>So they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name. </span> <span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>And daily in the temple, and in every house, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus <i>as</i> the Christ.</span></p>'

and they shall prophesy:</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come:</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.</span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</span></p><p><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>Until I make thy foes thy footstool.</span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?</span></p><p><span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</span></p><p><span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> our God shall call.</span></p><p><span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</span></p><p><span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.</span></p><p><span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>And they continued stedfastly in the apostles&apos; doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</span></p><p><span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</span></p><p><span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</span></p><p><span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.</span></p><p><span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</span></p><p><span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>Praising God, and having favour with all the people.

And she said, Yea, for so much.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon&apos;s porch.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught.

### Elders in the Early Church 

`Look up the following texts: <a class="verse" verse="Acts 6:1; Acts 6:6; Acts 14:23; Acts 15:6">Acts 6:1; Acts 6:6; Acts 14:23; Acts 15:6</a>; , <a class="verse" verse="1 Tim 5:17">1 Tim. 5:17</a>, <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 5:2">1 Pet. 5:2</a>. What insights do these verses give us regarding the challenges facing the early church and the role of its leaders?`

A large group of people becoming believers and joining the church is a great blessing from God. Yet, as the experience of the earliest Christians illustrates, rapid growth can bring problems. 

For instance, <a class="verse" verse="Acts 1–5">Acts 1–5</a> documents the leading of the Holy Spirit and the conversion of many to Christianity. <a class="verse" verse="Acts 6:1–6">Acts 6:1–6</a> shows the result: the group became too big for its leadership, and it needed to put structures in place in order to manage the day-to-day functions of the church. 

The issue that brought this weakness in organizational structure to a head was a complaint of discrimination. The Greek-speaking group complained that its widows were neglected in the daily distribution of food. As a response, a group of people, the deacons, were especially appointed to assist the 12 apostles with the management of the church’s resources.

It is true that the early church was led by the Holy Spirit in a special way. But even then there was a need to set up church structures. One key group of church leaders needed very early was the elders, who were established for each local congregation. In fact, appointing elders to lead these newly formed groups of Christians was something that Paul and Barnabas did as they went to places that had yet to hear about Jesus (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 14:23">Acts 14:23</a>).

Elders were given many different roles in early Christianity. As leaders of their local community, from time to time they acted as instructors in teaching new converts. They preached, and they ensured that the necessary things were done for the well-being of the community (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 15:6">Acts 15:6</a>, <a class="verse" verse="1 Tim 5:17">1 Tim. 5:17</a>, <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 5:2">1 Pet. 5:2</a>).

`What are ways that you can learn to work better with the leaders in your local church, even when you don’t always agree on things?`
