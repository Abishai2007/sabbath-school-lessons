#### Further Thought

So often we hear Christians talk about “freedom in Christ.” And, of course, this is a valid concept. To be free from the condemnation of the law and to have assurance of salvation because of what Christ has done for us and not from our own works is indeed to be free. The story of Martin Luther and the bondage from which he suffered before he understood grace is a great example of what this freedom can mean. However, as we saw in Peter, the wonderful truth can be twisted. “The great truth of our entire dependence upon Christ for salvation lies close to the error of presumption. Freedom in Christ is by thousands mistaken for lawlessness; and because Christ came to release us from the condemnation of the law, many declare that the law itself is done away, and that those who keep it are fallen from grace. And thus, as truth and error appear so near akin, minds that are not guided by the Holy Spirit will be led to accept the error and, in so doing, place themselves under the power of Satan’s deceptions. In thus leading people to receive error for truth, Satan is working to secure the homage of the Protestant world.”—Ellen G. White, Christ Triumphant, p. 324. 

#### Discussion Questions:

`Meditate on <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 2:19">2 Peter 2:19</a> and the other things Peter says about the results of the false teaching. Why must we be sure to learn for ourselves the crucial truths we believe? How important is it that we all agree exactly on what we should believe? When does it become “dangerous” to think ideas that are different from the rest of our fellow believers?`

`Look at some of the strong language of Peter in regard to the whole question of punishment and judgment: “bring upon themselves swift destruction” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2:1">2 Pet. 2:1</a>); “shall utterly perish in their own corruption” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2:12">2 Pet. 2:12</a>); “to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2:9">2 Pet. 2:9</a>); “and their destruction does not slumber” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2:3">2 Pet. 2:3</a>, NKJV). What should these texts tell us about not only the reality of judgment but about how strongly God condemns those who will lead His people into error?`

`What do you think it means when those who talk about “freedom in Christ” generally do so, not in the context of the law in general (though some do) but in the context of keeping the fourth commandment, the Sabbath commandment? How does this argument help us to see another way that the idea of “freedom in Christ” can be twisted?`
