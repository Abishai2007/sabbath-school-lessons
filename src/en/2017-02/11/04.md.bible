So shall it also be with this wicked generation.&#x201D;</span></span></p>'
            '2 Peter 2:17–22': '<h3> <span>2 Peter 2:17-22</span></h3><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>These are wells without water, clouds carried by a tempest, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For when they speak great swelling <i>words</i> of emptiness, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through lewdness, the ones who have actually escaped from those who live in error. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the latter end is worse for them than the beginning. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known <i>it,</i> to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: <span>&#x201C;A dog returns to his own vomit,&#x201D;</span> and, &#x201C;a sow, having washed, to her wallowing in the mire.&#x201D;</span></p>'

Therefore his father came out and pleaded with him.</span> </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup><span>So he answered and said to <i>his</i> father, &#x2018;Lo, these many years I have been serving you; I never transgressed your commandment at any time; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends.</span> </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup><span>But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots, you killed the fatted calf for him.&#x2019;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;And he said to him, &#x2018;Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.</span> </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup><span>It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></span></p>'

### A Dog Returns to Its Vomit

`Read <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 2:17–22">2 Peter 2:17–22</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 12:43–45">Matthew 12:43–45</a>. What are the dangers when a convert to Christianity returns to his or her former lifestyle?`

Peter was particularly concerned about the fate of those whom the false teachers entice back into their former sins (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2:18">2 Pet. 2:18</a>). The false teachers promise freedom, but as Peter points out, the freedom that they promise is radically different from the kind of freedom that Jesus promised those who followed Him.  

Look at the powerful warning Peter gave. It would have been better never to have “known the way of righteousness” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2:21">2 Pet. 2:21</a>) than to have known it and then turned back to their old ways. 

Of course, this doesn’t mean their case is hopeless. We all know stories of those who have turned away from the Lord and later have come back. And we know that the Lord is very glad when they do and happy to take them back. (See <a class="verse" verse="Luke 15:11–32">Luke 15:11–32</a>.) It means only that turning away is a very dangerous course to take, nor is it a pleasant one either. A dog returning to its own vomit is a crude and harsh way to describe it, but Peter makes his point with that image.

Perhaps the echo of the words of Jesus in <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 2:20">2 Peter 2:20</a> is intentional (see <a class="verse" verse="Matt 12:45">Matt. 12:45</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Luke 11:26">Luke 11:26</a>). Jesus tells the parable of a man who has been freed from an unclean spirit. The spirit wanders without a place of his own, and then returns to see “ ‘my house from which I came’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 12:44">Matt. 12:44</a>, NKJV). He arrives and finds it empty and put in order. He then moves back in, but he brings with him several other spirits more wicked than he is. As Jesus says, “ ‘The last state of that man is worse than the first’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 12:45">Matt. 12:45</a>, NKJV). The danger Jesus illustrates and Peter describes is real. The new believer needs to ensure that the things of the Spirit replace the things that used to dominate his or her life. If involvement in church and the sharing of the new faith do not replace the earlier secular activities, it is too easy to revert to one’s old ways. 

`What are ways we as a church family can better nurture and disciple all our members, especially newer ones?`
