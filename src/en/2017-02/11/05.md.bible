### Peter and Jude

Many people have observed that <a class="verse" verse="Jude 4–19">Jude 4–19</a> largely repeats the message of <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 2:1–3:7">2 Peter 2:1–3:7</a>. Whenever Scripture repeats a message, we should be aware that God wants to convey something important. In these similar passages, Peter and Jude take great lengths to notify us of an important truth: God is in control of the destinies of the wicked. Both Peter and Jude leave us with no doubt that God is closely monitoring evil. Whether unrighteous humanity or the fallen angels, God has taken special note of their evil and has planned their punishment on the day of judgment (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2:9, 17">2 Pet. 2:9, 17</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Jude 6">Jude 6</a>).  

`Read <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 2:1–3:7">2 Peter 2:1–3:7</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Jude 4–19">Jude 4–19</a>. What examples of God’s earlier vengeance do Peter and Jude give to punctuate the fact that God means business in dealing with sin?` 

Peter and Jude record three examples of God’s vengeance in the past. They include the destruction of the antediluvian world by the Flood, the incineration of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the chaining of angelic beings for destruction (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2:4–6; 3:7">2 Pet. 2:4–6; 3:7</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Jude 6, 7">Jude 6, 7</a>). All of these episodes are laced with a lingering sense of finality. Though Scripture speaks a great deal about God’s mercy and grace, God’s justice also plays an important role in the final destruction of sin. 

What were the sins that engendered such severe punishment? They include introducing destructive heresies; despising authority; enslavement to whatever has mastered them; perverting the grace of God into a license for immorality; denying Jesus Christ as the only Sovereign and Lord; polluting their own bodies; speaking empty, boastful words; and slandering (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2; 2 Pet 2:1; 2 Pet 2:10; 2 Pet 2:19">2 Pet. 2; 2 Pet. 2:1; 2 Pet. 2:10; 2 Pet. 2:19</a>; ; <a class="verse" verse="Jude 4">Jude 4</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Jude 8">Jude 8</a>; <a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2:18">2 Pet. 2:18</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Jude 10">Jude 10</a>, NIV). 

Interestingly, these descriptions do not include violent acts and other wicked atrocities that often outrage us. Instead, they describe more subtle sins that have one commonality. They are sins that are sometimes excused within the church community itself. This fact should awaken us to the great need for sincere repentance and reformation in the church. 

`Read <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 2:12">2 Peter 2:12</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Jude 10">Jude 10</a>. Here Peter and Jude describe those who are facing destruction as having degraded into “unreasoning” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2:12">2 Pet. 2:12</a>, NIV) or “irrational” animals (<a class="verse" verse="Jude 10">Jude 10</a>, NIV) ruled by instinct. How does that description compare to how God originally created humanity, and how can you prevent that from happening in your life?`
