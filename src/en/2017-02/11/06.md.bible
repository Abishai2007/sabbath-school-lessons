            'Numbers 22:1–24:25': '<h3> <span>Numbers 22-24</span></h3><p><span><span>22&#xA0;</span>Then the children of Israel moved, and camped in the plains of Moab on the side of the Jordan <i>across from</i> Jericho.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Now Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And Moab was exceedingly afraid of the people because they <i>were</i> many, and Moab was sick with dread because of the children of Israel. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>So Moab said to the elders of Midian, &#x201C;Now this company will lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.&#x201D; And Balak the son of Zippor <i>was</i> king of the Moabites at that time. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Then he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which <i>is</i> near the River in the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying: &#x201C;Look, a people has come from Egypt. See, they cover the face of the earth, and are settling next to me! </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Therefore please come at once, curse this people for me, for they <i>are</i> too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land, for I know that he whom you bless <i>is</i> blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the diviner&#x2019;s fee in their hand, and they came to Balaam and spoke to him the words of Balak. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And he said to them, &#x201C;Lodge here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> speaks to me.&#x201D; So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then God came to Balaam and said, &#x201C;Who <i>are</i> these men with you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>So Balaam said to God, &#x201C;Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, <i>saying,</i> </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>&#x2018;Look, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the face of the earth. Come now, curse them for me; perhaps I shall be able to overpower them and drive them out.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And God said to Balaam, &#x201C;You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they <i>are</i> blessed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>So Balaam rose in the morning and said to the princes of Balak, &#x201C;Go back to your land, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has refused to give me permission to go with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak, and said, &#x201C;Balaam refuses to come with us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Then Balak again sent princes, more numerous and more honorable than they. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And they came to Balaam and said to him, &#x201C;Thus says Balak the son of Zippor: &#x2018;Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me; </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>for I will certainly honor you greatly, and I will do whatever you say to me. Therefore please come, curse this people for me.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Then Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, &#x201C;Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> my God, to do less or more. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Now therefore, please, you also stay here tonight, that I may know what more the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will say to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, &#x201C;If the men come to call you, rise <i>and</i> go with them; but only the word which I speak to you&#x2014;that you shall do.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>So Balaam rose in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Then God&#x2019;s anger was aroused because he went, and the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> took His stand in the way as an adversary against him. And he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants <i>were</i> with him. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Now the donkey saw the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. So Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Then the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, <i>with</i> a wall on this side and a wall on that side. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>And when the donkey saw the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, she pushed herself against the wall and crushed Balaam&#x2019;s foot against the wall; so he struck her again. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>Then the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> went further, and stood in a narrow place where there <i>was</i> no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>And when the donkey saw the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, she lay down under Balaam; so Balaam&#x2019;s anger was aroused, and he struck the donkey with his staff.</span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, &#x201C;What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>And Balaam said to the donkey, &#x201C;Because you have abused me. I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would kill you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>So the donkey said to Balaam, &#x201C;<i>Am</i> I not your donkey on which you have ridden, ever since <i>I became</i> yours, to this day? Was I ever disposed to do this to you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>And he said, &#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> opened Balaam&#x2019;s eyes, and he saw the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand; and he bowed his head and fell flat on his face. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, &#x201C;Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to stand against you, because <i>your</i> way is perverse before Me. </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>And Balaam said to the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, &#x201C;I have sinned, for I did not know You stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases You, I will turn back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>Then the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Balaam, &#x201C;Go with the men, but only the word that I speak to you, that you shall speak.&#x201D; So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>Now when Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which <i>is</i> on the border at the Arnon, the boundary of the territory. </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>Then Balak said to Balaam, &#x201C;Did I not earnestly send to you, calling for you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>And Balaam said to Balak, &#x201C;Look, I have come to you! Now, have I any power at all to say anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I must speak.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>So Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjath Huzoth. </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>Then Balak offered oxen and sheep, and he sent <i>some</i> to Balaam and to the princes who <i>were</i> with him.</span></p><p><span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>So it was, the next day, that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal, that from there he might observe the extent of the people.</span></p><p><span><span>23&#xA0;</span>Then Balaam said to Balak, &#x201C;Build seven altars for me here, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on <i>each</i> altar. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then Balaam said to Balak, &#x201C;Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will tell you.&#x201D; So he went to a desolate height. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And God met Balaam, and he said to Him, &#x201C;I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered on <i>each</i> altar a bull and a ram.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> put a word in Balaam&#x2019;s mouth, and said, &#x201C;Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>So he returned to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, he and all the princes of Moab.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And he took up his oracle and said:</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram,</span><br><span>From the mountains of the east.</span><br><span>&#x2018;Come, curse Jacob for me,</span><br><span>And come, denounce Israel!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?</span><br><span>And how shall I denounce <i>whom</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has not denounced?</span><br><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>For from the top of the rocks I see him,</span><br><span>And from the hills I behold him;</span><br><span>There! A people dwelling alone,</span><br><span>Not reckoning itself among the nations.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Who can count the dust of Jacob,</span><br><span>Or number one-fourth of Israel?</span><br><span>Let me die the death of the righteous,</span><br><span>And let my end be like his!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Then Balak said to Balaam, &#x201C;What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and look, you have blessed <i>them</i> bountifully!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>So he answered and said, &#x201C;Must I not take heed to speak what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has put in my mouth?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Then Balak said to him, &#x201C;Please come with me to another place from which you may see them; you shall see only the outer part of them, and shall not see them all; curse them for me from there.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>So he brought him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on <i>each</i> altar.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And he said to Balak, &#x201C;Stand here by your burnt offering while I meet <i>the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></i> over there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, &#x201C;Go back to Balak, and thus you shall speak.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>So he came to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab were with him. And Balak said to him, &#x201C;What has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> spoken?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Then he took up his oracle and said:</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Rise up, Balak, and hear!</span><br><span>Listen to me, son of Zippor!</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;God <i>is</i> not a man, that He should lie,</span><br><span>Nor a son of man, that He should repent.</span><br><span>Has He said, and will He not do?</span><br><span>Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?</span><br><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Behold, I have received <i>a command</i> to bless;</span><br><span>He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;He has not observed iniquity in Jacob,</span><br><span>Nor has He seen wickedness in Israel.</span><br><span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> his God <i>is</i> with him,</span><br><span>And the shout of a King <i>is</i> among them.</span><br><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>God brings them out of Egypt;</span><br><span>He has strength like a wild ox.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;For <i>there is</i> no sorcery against Jacob,</span><br><span>Nor any divination against Israel.</span><br><span>It now must be said of Jacob</span><br><span>And of Israel, &#x2018;Oh, what God has done!&#x2019;</span><br><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Look, a people rises like a lioness,</span><br><span>And lifts itself up like a lion;</span><br><span>It shall not lie down until it devours the prey,</span><br><span>And drinks the blood of the slain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Then Balak said to Balaam, &#x201C;Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>So Balaam answered and said to Balak, &#x201C;Did I not tell you, saying, &#x2018;All that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> speaks, that I must do&#x2019;?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Then Balak said to Balaam, &#x201C;Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that overlooks the wasteland. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Then Balaam said to Balak, &#x201C;Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on <i>every</i> altar.</span></p><p><span><span>24&#xA0;</span>Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times, to seek to use sorcery, but he set his face toward the wilderness. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And Balaam raised his eyes, and saw Israel encamped according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then he took up his oracle and said:</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor,</span><br><span>The utterance of the man whose eyes are opened,</span><br><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>The utterance of him who hears the words of God,</span><br><span>Who sees the vision of the Almighty,</span><br><span>Who falls down, with eyes wide open:</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;How lovely are your tents, O Jacob!</span><br><span>Your dwellings, O Israel!</span><br><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Like valleys that stretch out,</span><br><span>Like gardens by the riverside,</span><br><span>Like aloes planted by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>,</span><br><span>Like cedars beside the waters.</span><br><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>He shall pour water from his buckets,</span><br><span>And his seed <i>shall be</i> in many waters.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;His king shall be higher than Agag,</span><br><span>And his kingdom shall be exalted.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;God brings him out of Egypt;</span><br><span>He has strength like a wild ox;</span><br><span>He shall consume the nations, his enemies;</span><br><span>He shall break their bones</span><br><span>And pierce <i>them</i> with his arrows.</span><br><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>&#x2018;He bows down, he lies down as a lion;</span><br><span>And as a lion, who shall rouse him?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Blessed <i>is</i> he who blesses you,</span><br><span>And cursed <i>is</i> he who curses you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Then Balak&#x2019;s anger was aroused against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, &#x201C;I called you to curse my enemies, and look, you have bountifully blessed <i>them</i> these three times! </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Now therefore, flee to your place. I said I would greatly honor you, but in fact, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has kept you back from honor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>So Balaam said to Balak, &#x201C;Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying, </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>&#x2018;If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, to do good or bad of my own will. What the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> says, that I must speak&#x2019;? </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And now, indeed, I am going to my people. Come, I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the latter days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>So he took up his oracle and said:</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor,</span><br><span>And the utterance of the man whose eyes are opened;</span><br><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>The utterance of him who hears the words of God,</span><br><span>And has the knowledge of the Most High,</span><br><span><i>Who</i> sees the vision of the Almighty,</span><br><span><i>Who</i> falls down, with eyes wide open:</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;I see Him, but not now;</span><br><span>I behold Him, but not near;</span><br><span>A Star shall come out of Jacob;</span><br><span>A Scepter shall rise out of Israel,</span><br><span>And batter the brow of Moab,</span><br><span>And destroy all the sons of tumult.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;And Edom shall be a possession;</span><br><span>Seir also, his enemies, shall be a possession,</span><br><span>While Israel does valiantly.</span><br><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Out of Jacob One shall have dominion,</span><br><span>And destroy the remains of the city.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Then he looked on Amalek, and he took up his oracle and said:</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Amalek <i>was</i> first among the nations,</span><br><span>But <i>shall be</i> last until he perishes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Then he looked on the Kenites, and he took up his oracle and said:</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Firm is your dwelling place,</span><br><span>And your nest is set in the rock;</span><br><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless Kain shall be burned.</span><br><span>How long until Asshur carries you away captive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Then he took up his oracle and said:</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Alas! Who shall live when God does this?</span><br><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>But ships <i>shall come</i> from the coasts of Cyprus,</span><br><span>And they shall afflict Asshur and afflict Eber,</span><br><span>And so shall <i>Amalek,</i> until he perishes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>So Balaam rose and departed and returned to his place; Balak also went his way.</span></p>'
            'Genesis 13:12, 13': '<h3> <span>Genesis 13:12</span></h3><p> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched <i>his</i> tent even as far as Sodom. </span> </p><h3> <span>Genesis 13:13</span></h3><p> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>But the men of Sodom <i>were</i> exceedingly wicked and sinful against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p>'
            '2 Pet 2:14, 15': '<h3> <span>2 Peter 2:14</span></h3><p> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls.

### More Old Testament Lessons 

`Read <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 2:6–16">2 Peter 2:6–16</a>. What other examples does Peter use to give his warning about what wickedness will lead to?`

The first substantive reference to Sodom in the Bible is <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 13:12, 13">Genesis 13:12, 13</a>. Lot and Abraham decided to separate for “financial” reasons. Lot chose the Jordan Valley and “pitched his tent toward Sodom” (<a class="verse" verse="Gen 13:12">Gen. 13:12</a>). The Bible then comments, “Now the people of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the Lord” (<a class="verse" verse="Gen 13:13">Gen. 13:13</a>, NRSV). Later, when God warned Abraham that He was planning to destroy Sodom, Abraham negotiated an agreement that God would not destroy it if ten righteous people were found there (<a class="verse" verse="Gen 18:16–33">Gen. 18:16–33</a>). The unlikelihood of finding even ten righteous people in Sodom was amply demonstrated by what happened to the messengers sent to visit Lot. The city was duly destroyed; only Lot and his two daughters escaped (<a class="verse" verse="Gen 19:12–25">Gen. 19:12–25</a>). 

Peter derives two lessons from this story. First, the two cities provide an example of the punishment coming to the ungodly (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2:6">2 Pet. 2:6</a>). Second, it shows that the Lord knows how to rescue the righteous from trial (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2:7–9">2 Pet. 2:7–9</a>). Peter then notes some of the characteristics of those who were destroyed at Sodom and Gomorrah: they indulge their flesh in depraved lust, despise authority, are bold and willful, and do not hesitate to slander the angels (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2:10, 11">2 Pet. 2:10, 11</a>). These characteristics have similarities to how Peter describes the false teachers and their followers.  

The story of Balaam is found in <a class="verse" verse="Numbers 22:1–24:25">Numbers 22:1–24:25</a>. He had been hired by Balak, king of Moab, to curse the Israelites. At first reluctant, he was eventually persuaded to take on this task by the offer of a larger sum of money (<a class="verse" verse="Num 22:7–21">Num. 22:7–21</a>). On his way he was confronted by an “angel of the Lord” and was saved from death only when his donkey turned aside. Balaam then beat his donkey and realized his mistake only when his eyes were opened and he saw the “angel of the Lord” himself (<a class="verse" verse="Num 22:22–35">Num. 22:22–35</a>). In the end, Balaam ended up blessing Israel (<a class="verse" verse="Num 23:4–24:24">Num. 23:4–24:24</a>). Peter used Balaam as an example of those enticed by adultery and greed (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2:14, 15">2 Pet. 2:14, 15</a>). Such people are like Balaam. They have left the path that they should follow.
