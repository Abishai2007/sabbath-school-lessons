### Faith in the Face of Death 

`Read <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 1:12–15">2 Peter 1:12–15</a>. What does Peter mean when he suggests that he is soon to put off his tent/body?`

Second Peter 1:12–14 reveals the occasion of the letter. Peter thinks he is about to die, and the letter contains his last message or testament.

That Peter expects to die soon is revealed by the phraseology “as long as I am in this tabernacle. . . . Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle,” which is found in <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 1:13, 14">2 Peter 1:13, 14</a>. Peter likens the body to a tent (tabernacle), which he will put off as he dies. In fact, it is so clear that Peter means his body when he refers to putting off his tent that modern translators tend to translate these phrases as “as long as I am in this body . . . since I know that my death will come soon” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 1:13, 14">2 Pet. 1:13, 14</a>, NRSV). Nothing in Peter’s language suggests that when Peter “puts off” his tent or body, his soul will survive as a separate entity.  

`Read <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 1:12–15">2 Peter 1:12–15</a> again. How does Peter appear to deal with the reality of his impending death, and what does that attitude teach us about faith?`  

Second Peter 1:12–15 gives added solemnity to Peter’s words. He writes this in the knowledge that his life will soon come to an end. He knows this because, as he said, the “Lord Jesus showed me.” Yet, there seems to be no fear, no worry, no foreboding. His emphasis, instead, is on the well-being of those whom he is leaving behind. He wants them to be firm in the “present truth,” and—as long as he is alive—he is going to admonish them to be faithful. 

We can see here the reality and depth of Peter’s experience with the Lord. Yes, he’s going to die soon, and it will not be a pleasant death, either (see <a class="verse" verse="John 21:18">John 21:18</a>; Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 537, 538), but his unselfish concern is about the benefit of others. Truly, Peter was a man living out the faith that he taught.

`How does our faith help us deal with the terrible reality of death? How can we learn to cling to the wonderful hope we have, even in the face of death, because of what Jesus has done for us?`
