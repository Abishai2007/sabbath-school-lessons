            '1 Thessalonians 4:16–18': '<h3> <span>1 Thessalonians 4:16-18</span></h3><p> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Then we who are alive <i>and</i> remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Therefore comfort one another with these words.</span></p>'
            '1 Corinthians 15:12–57': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 15:12-57</span></h3><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching <i>is</i> empty and your faith <i>is</i> also empty. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up&#x2014;if in fact the dead do not rise. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>For if <i>the</i> dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>And if Christ is not risen, your faith <i>is</i> futile; you are still in your sins! </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>But now Christ is risen from the dead, <i>and</i> has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>For since by man <i>came</i> death, by Man also <i>came</i> the resurrection of the dead. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those <i>who are</i> Christ&#x2019;s at His coming. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Then <i>comes</i> the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>The last enemy <i>that</i> will be destroyed <i>is</i> death. </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>For <span>&#x201C;He has put all things under His feet.&#x201D;</span> But when He says &#x201C;all things are put under <i>Him,</i>&#x201D; <i>it is</i> evident that He who put all things under Him is excepted. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Now when all things are made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why then are they baptized for the dead? </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>And why do we stand in jeopardy every hour? </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>If, in the manner of men, I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage <i>is it</i> to me? If <i>the</i> dead do not rise, <span>&#x201C;Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Do not be deceived: &#x201C;Evil company corrupts good habits.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Awake to righteousness, and do not sin; for some do not have the knowledge of God. I speak <i>this</i> to your shame.</span></p><p><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>But someone will say, &#x201C;How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>Foolish one, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies. </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>And what you sow, you do not sow that body that shall be, but mere grain&#x2014;perhaps wheat or some other <i>grain.</i> </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>But God gives it a body as He pleases, and to each seed its own body.</span></p><p><span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>All flesh <i>is</i> not the same flesh, but <i>there is</i> one <i>kind of</i> flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, <i>and</i> another of birds.</span></p><p><span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup><i>There are</i> also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial <i>is</i> one, and the <i>glory</i> of the terrestrial <i>is</i> another. </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup><i>There is</i> one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for <i>one</i> star differs from <i>another</i> star in glory.</span></p><p><span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>So also <i>is</i> the resurrection of the dead. <i>The body</i> is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption. </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. </span> <span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. </span> <span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>And so it is written, <span>&#x201C;The first man Adam became a living being.&#x201D;</span> The last Adam <i>became</i> a life-giving spirit.</span></p><p><span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual. </span> <span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>The first man <i>was</i> of the earth, <i>made</i> of dust; the second Man <i>is</i> the Lord from heaven. </span> <span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>As <i>was</i> the <i>man</i> of dust, so also <i>are</i> those <i>who are made</i> of dust; and as <i>is</i> the heavenly <i>Man,</i> so also <i>are</i> those <i>who are</i> heavenly. </span> <span><sup>49&#xA0;</sup>And as we have borne the image of the <i>man</i> of dust, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly <i>Man.</i></span></p><p><span><sup>50&#xA0;</sup>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does corruption inherit incorruption. </span> <span><sup>51&#xA0;</sup>Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>52&#xA0;</sup>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. </span> <span><sup>53&#xA0;</sup>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal <i>must</i> put on immortality. </span> <span><sup>54&#xA0;</sup>So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: <span>&#x201C;Death is swallowed up in victory.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>55&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;O Death, where <i>is</i> your sting?</span></span><br><span><span>O Hades, where</span> <i>is</i> <span>your victory?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>56&#xA0;</sup>The sting of death <i>is</i> sin, and the strength of sin <i>is</i> the law. </span> <span><sup>57&#xA0;</sup>But thanks <i>be</i> to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>'

### Shedding the Tent

`“Yes, I think it is right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by reminding you, knowing that shortly I must put off my tent, just as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 1:13, 14">2 Pet. 1:13, 14</a>, NKJV).

In 1956, Oscar Cullmann wrote a short study called Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead? The Witness of the New Testament. He argued that the concept of the resurrection is quite incompatible with the concept of the immortal soul. Furthermore, he said that the New Testament lies squarely on the side of the resurrection of the dead.  

“No other publication of mine,” he later wrote, “has provoked such enthusiasm or such violent hostility.”

`Read <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 15:12–57">1 Corinthians 15:12–57</a>. What does Paul imply happens in death?`

A study of what the New Testament says about death and resurrection has convinced most New Testament scholars that Cullmann was correct. The New Testament indeed assumes the concept of resurrection, not the concept of an immortal soul that survives the death of the body. For example, in <a class="verse" verse="1 Thessalonians 4:16–18">1 Thessalonians 4:16–18</a>, Paul urges those who have lost loved ones to death to be comforted with the knowledge that when Jesus returns again, He will raise the dead. In <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 15:12–57">1 Corinthians 15:12–57</a>, Paul gives an extended description of resurrection. He begins by pointing out that Christian faith is based on the resurrection of Jesus. If Jesus was not raised, then any faith in Him is futile. But, says Paul, Christ has indeed risen from the dead, as the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. And Christ’s resurrection from the dead makes it possible for all those in Him to rise from the dead, as well.

Paul talks about the resurrection body in <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 15:35–50">1 Corinthians 15:35–50</a>. He contrasts the new bodies we will receive in the resurrection with our present bodies. What we have now will die; what we will have in the resurrection never will.  

In summary, when the New Testament talks about death, it does so in terms of resurrection, not immortality of the soul. This is important to know as a background to reading <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 1:12–14">2 Peter 1:12–14</a>.
