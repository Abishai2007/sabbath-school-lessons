#### The Canceled Funeral: Part 1

One day after school, I overheard my sister talking to a friend. “But it happened,” a girl said. “The man was dead, and now he’s alive. How can a dead person come back to life? I wondered. Then I said aloud, “That could never happen.” 

“It’s the truth,” my sister said. “The man was dead, and now he’s alive.” 

I knew that God had raised people from the dead in Bible times. But miracles such as that didn’t happen anymore. Or did they? I knelt and prayed the prayer of Thomas. “Lord, if this is true, let me see it with my own eyes. Then I will believe” (<a class="verse" verse="John 20:25">John 20:25</a>, NIV).

After a while, I forgot about this strange story about a dead man being raised to life.

When I finished high school, I applied to serve as a Global Mission pioneer before starting college. 

A Global Mission pioneer is a layperson chosen by the church, given a small stipend, and asked to move into a community and teach the everlasting gospel while modeling the values of Christianity. Pioneers serve a unique and special role in starting new congregations in new areas among new people groups. 

I was assigned to a remote region of central Nigeria where few outsiders ever went and where we had no Seventh-day Adventist believers. I settled in a village and began making friends. Most of the villagers worshiped idols, but some allowed me to share the gospel with them. One teenage girl named One-Ojo seemed especially interested in learning about God. I began studying the Bible with her. 

Then one afternoon, a boy ran into my room shouting that One-Ojo was dead. “She died last night,” the boy said. “The family wants you to come before they bury her.”

Dazed, I slipped on my shoes and ran toward One-Ojo’s home. When I arrived, I found her body lying on a straw mat bound hand and foot and ready for burial. I stared at her as I thought about our Bible study just the evening before. How could she be dead? I wondered. I touched her arm; it was stiff and cold.

I asked for permission to pray before the family buried her. About twenty people in the room watched as I knelt beside her burial mat and prayed. I asked God to give this girl her life back to teach these people that God is all-powerful. 

I had been praying for about an hour when I noticed beads of sweat on One-Ojo’s body. I laid my hand on her arm and felt warmth. Encouraged, I continued praying. Then One-Ojo sneezed.
