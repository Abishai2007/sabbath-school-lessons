            'Matthew 26:31–35, 69–75': '<h3> <span>Matthew 26:31-35</span></h3><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;All of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, for it is written:</span></span></p><p><span><span>&#x2018;I will strike the Shepherd,</span></span><br><span><span>And the sheep of the flock will be scattered.&#x2019;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup><span>But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Peter answered and said to Him, &#x201C;Even if all are made to stumble because of You, I will never be made to stumble.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;Assuredly, I say to you that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>Peter said to Him, &#x201C;Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>And so said all the disciples.</span></p><h3> <span>Matthew 26:69-75</span></h3><p><span><sup>69&#xA0;</sup>Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him, saying, &#x201C;You also were with Jesus of Galilee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>70&#xA0;</sup>But he denied it before <i>them</i> all, saying, &#x201C;I do not know what you are saying.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>71&#xA0;</sup>And when he had gone out to the gateway, another <i>girl</i> saw him and said to those <i>who were</i> there, &#x201C;This <i>fellow</i> also was with Jesus of Nazareth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>72&#xA0;</sup>But again he denied with an oath, &#x201C;I do not know the Man!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>73&#xA0;</sup>And a little later those who stood by came up and said to Peter, &#x201C;Surely you also are <i>one</i> of them, for your speech betrays you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>74&#xA0;</sup>Then he began to curse and swear, <i>saying,</i> &#x201C;I do not know the Man!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Immediately a rooster crowed. </span> <span><sup>75&#xA0;</sup>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus who had said to him, <span>&#x201C;Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.&#x201D;</span> So he went out and wept bitterly.</span></p>'
            'Galatians 2:11–14': '<h3> <span>Galatians 2:11-14</span></h3><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed; </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>for before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before <i>them</i> all, &#x201C;If you, being a Jew, live in the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews, why do you compel Gentiles to live as Jews? </span> </p>'
            'Matthew 16:21–23': '<h3> <span>Matthew 16:21-23</span></h3><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, &#x201C;Far be it from You, Lord; this shall not happen to You!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But He turned and said to Peter, <span>&#x201C;Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.&#x201D;</span></span></p>'
            'Matthew 14:25–33': '<h3> <span>Matthew 14:25-33</span></h3><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, &#x201C;It is a ghost!&#x201D; And they cried out for fear.</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span>&#x201C;Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And Peter answered Him and said, &#x201C;Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>So He said, <span>&#x201C;Come.&#x201D;</span> And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>But when he saw that the wind <i>was</i> boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, &#x201C;Lord, save me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>And immediately Jesus stretched out <i>His</i> hand and caught him, and said to him, <span>&#x201C;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, &#x201C;Truly You are the Son of God.&#x201D;</span></p>'
            'Matthew 16:13–19': '<h3> <span>Matthew 16:13-19</span></h3><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, <span>&#x201C;Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>So they said, &#x201C;Some <i>say</i> John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>He said to them, <span>&#x201C;But who do you say that I am?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Simon Peter answered and said, &#x201C;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, <span>&#x201C;Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed <i>this</i> to you, but My Father who is in heaven.</span> </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup><span>And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.</span> </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup><span>And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed</span><span> in heaven.&#x201D;</span></span></p>'
            'Matt 14:13–24': '<h3> <span>Matthew 14:13-24</span></h3><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>When Jesus heard <i>it,</i> He departed from there by boat to a deserted place by Himself. But when the multitudes heard it, they followed Him on foot from the cities. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>When it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, &#x201C;This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>But Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>And they said to Him, &#x201C;We have here only five loaves and two fish.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>He said, <span>&#x201C;Bring them here to Me.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Then He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>So they all ate and were filled, and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Now those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, while He sent the multitudes away. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. Now when evening came, He was alone there. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</span></p>'
            '1 Peter 5:5, 6': '<h3> <span>1 Peter 5:5</span></h3><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Likewise you younger people, submit yourselves to <i>your</i> elders. Yes, all of <i>you</i> be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility, for</span></p><p><span><span>&#x201C;God resists the proud,</span></span><br><span><span>But gives grace to the humble.&#x201D;</span></span></p><h3> <span>1 Peter 5:6</span></h3><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, </span> </p>'

            'Luke 9:44, 45': '<h3> <span>Luke 9:44</span></h3><p> <span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;Let these words sink down into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.&#x201D;</span> </span> </p><h3> <span>Luke 9:45</span></h3><p> <span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>But they did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this saying.</span></p>'

And He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, <span>&#x201C;Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>But Simon answered and said to Him, &#x201C;Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>So they signaled to <i>their</i> partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>When Simon Peter saw <i>it,</i> he fell down at Jesus&#x2019; knees, saying, &#x201C;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken; </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>and so also <i>were</i> James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.

            'Matthew 26': '<h3> <span>Matthew 26</span></h3><p><span><span>26&#xA0;</span>Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, <i>that</i> He said to His disciples, </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;You know that after two days is the Passover, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people assembled at the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>and plotted to take Jesus by trickery and kill <i>Him.</i> </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>But they said, &#x201C;Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And when Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>a woman came to Him having an alabaster flask of very costly fragrant oil, and she poured <i>it</i> on His head as He sat <i>at the table.</i> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But when His disciples saw <i>it,</i> they were indignant, saying, &#x201C;Why this waste? </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>For this fragrant oil might have been sold for much and given to <i>the</i> poor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>But when Jesus was aware of <i>it,</i> He said to them, <span>&#x201C;Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work for Me.</span> </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup><span>For you have the poor with you always, but Me you do not have always.</span> </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup><span>For in pouring this fragrant oil on My body, she did <i>it</i> for My burial.</span> </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup><span>Assuredly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told as a memorial to her.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>and said, &#x201C;What are you willing to give me if I deliver Him to you?&#x201D; And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>So from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Now on the first <i>day of the Feast</i> of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, &#x201C;Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>And He said, <span>&#x201C;Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, &#x2018;The Teacher says, &#x201C;My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.&#x201D;&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>When evening had come, He sat down with the twelve. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Now as they were eating, He said, <span>&#x201C;Assuredly, I say to you, one of you will betray Me.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and each of them began to say to Him, &#x201C;Lord, is it I?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>He answered and said, <span>&#x201C;He who dipped <i>his</i> hand with Me in the dish will betray Me.</span> </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup><span>The Son of Man indeed goes just as it is written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Then Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, &#x201C;Rabbi, is it I?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He said to him, <span>&#x201C;You have said it.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke <i>it,</i> and gave <i>it</i> to the disciples and said, <span>&#x201C;Take, eat; this is My body.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave <i>it</i> to them, saying, <span>&#x201C;Drink from it, all of you.</span> </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup><span>For this is My blood of the new</span><span> covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</span> </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup><span>But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father&#x2019;s kingdom.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;All of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, for it is written:</span></span></p><p><span><span>&#x2018;I will strike the Shepherd,</span></span><br><span><span>And the sheep of the flock will be scattered.&#x2019;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup><span>But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Peter answered and said to Him, &#x201C;Even if all are made to stumble because of You, I will never be made to stumble.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;Assuredly, I say to you that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>Peter said to Him, &#x201C;Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>And so said all the disciples.</span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, <span>&#x201C;Sit here while I go and pray over there.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed. </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>Then He said to them, <span>&#x201C;My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with Me.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, <span>&#x201C;O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You <i>will.</i>&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, <span>&#x201C;What! Could you not watch with Me one hour?</span> </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup><span>Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed <i>is</i> willing, but the flesh <i>is</i> weak.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, <span>&#x201C;O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless</span><span> I drink it, Your will be done.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.</span></p><p><span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>So He left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. </span> <span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>Then He came to His disciples and said to them, <span>&#x201C;Are <i>you</i> still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> </span> <span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup><span>Rise, let us be going. See, My betrayer is at hand.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span></p><p><span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying, &#x201C;Whomever I kiss, He is the One; seize Him.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>49&#xA0;</sup>Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, &#x201C;Greetings, Rabbi!&#x201D; and kissed Him.</span></p><p><span><sup>50&#xA0;</sup>But Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;Friend, why have you come?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span>Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him. </span> <span><sup>51&#xA0;</sup>And suddenly, one of those <i>who were</i> with Jesus stretched out <i>his</i> hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</span></p><p><span><sup>52&#xA0;</sup>But Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish</span><span> by the sword.</span> </span> <span><sup>53&#xA0;</sup><span>Or do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels?</span> </span> <span><sup>54&#xA0;</sup><span>How then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>55&#xA0;</sup>In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, <span>&#x201C;Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take Me? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me.</span> </span> <span><sup>56&#xA0;</sup><span>But all this was done that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span>Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.</span></p><p><span><sup>57&#xA0;</sup>And those who had laid hold of Jesus led <i>Him</i> away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. </span> <span><sup>58&#xA0;</sup>But Peter followed Him at a distance to the high priest&#x2019;s courtyard. And he went in and sat with the servants to see the end.</span></p><p><span><sup>59&#xA0;</sup>Now the chief priests, the elders, and all the council sought false testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, </span> <span><sup>60&#xA0;</sup>but found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward </span> <span><sup>61&#xA0;</sup>and said, &#x201C;This <i>fellow</i> said, &#x2018;I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>62&#xA0;</sup>And the high priest arose and said to Him, &#x201C;Do You answer nothing? What <i>is it</i> these men testify against You?&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>63&#xA0;</sup>But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, &#x201C;I put You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>64&#xA0;</sup>Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;<i>It is as</i> you said. Nevertheless, I say to you, hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>65&#xA0;</sup>Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, &#x201C;He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? Look, now you have heard His blasphemy! </span> <span><sup>66&#xA0;</sup>What do you think?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They answered and said, &#x201C;He is deserving of death.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>67&#xA0;</sup>Then they spat in His face and beat Him; and others struck <i>Him</i> with the palms of their hands, </span> <span><sup>68&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x201C;Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who struck You?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>69&#xA0;</sup>Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him, saying, &#x201C;You also were with Jesus of Galilee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>70&#xA0;</sup>But he denied it before <i>them</i> all, saying, &#x201C;I do not know what you are saying.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>71&#xA0;</sup>And when he had gone out to the gateway, another <i>girl</i> saw him and said to those <i>who were</i> there, &#x201C;This <i>fellow</i> also was with Jesus of Nazareth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>72&#xA0;</sup>But again he denied with an oath, &#x201C;I do not know the Man!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>73&#xA0;</sup>And a little later those who stood by came up and said to Peter, &#x201C;Surely you also are <i>one</i> of them, for your speech betrays you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>74&#xA0;</sup>Then he began to curse and swear, <i>saying,</i> &#x201C;I do not know the Man!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Immediately a rooster crowed. </span> <span><sup>75&#xA0;</sup>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus who had said to him, <span>&#x201C;Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.&#x201D;</span> So he went out and wept bitterly.</span></p>'

But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>54&#xA0;</sup>Having arrested Him, they led <i>Him</i> and brought Him into the high priest&#x2019;s house.

Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, <span>&#x201C;Before the rooster crows,</span><span> you will deny Me three times.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>62&#xA0;</sup>So Peter went out and wept bitterly.</span></p><p><span><sup>63&#xA0;</sup>Now the men who held Jesus mocked Him and beat Him. </span> <span><sup>64&#xA0;</sup>And having blindfolded Him, they struck Him on the face and asked Him, saying, &#x201C;Prophesy! Who is the one who struck You?&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>65&#xA0;</sup>And many other things they blasphemously spoke against Him.</span></p><p><span><sup>66&#xA0;</sup>As soon as it was day, the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, came together and led Him into their council, saying, </span> <span><sup>67&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;If You are the Christ, tell us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But He said to them, <span>&#x201C;If I tell you, you will by no means believe.</span> </span> <span><sup>68&#xA0;</sup><span>And if I also ask <i>you,</i> you will by no means answer Me or let <i>Me</i> go. </span> </span> <span><sup>69&#xA0;</sup><span>Hereafter the Son of Man will sit on the right hand of the power of God.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>70&#xA0;</sup>Then they all said, &#x201C;Are You then the Son of God?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>So He said to them, <span>&#x201C;You <i>rightly</i> say that I am.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>71&#xA0;</sup>And they said, &#x201C;What further testimony do we need?

            'Luke 22': '<h3> <span>Luke 22</span></h3><p><span><span>22&#xA0;</span>Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.</span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</span></p><p><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.</span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.</span></p><p><span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.</span></p><p><span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords.

And he touched his ear, and healed him.</span></p><p><span><sup>52&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</span></p><p><span><sup>53&#xA0;</sup>When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</span></p><p><span><sup>54&#xA0;</sup>Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest&apos;s house.

### _The Lesson in Brief_

**Key Texts**: <a class="verse" verse="Luke 5:1–11">Luke 5:1–11</a>

#### **The Student Will:**
- **Know:** Recognize his or her own inadequacy while trusting in Jesus’ power to accomplish His mission.
- **Feel:** Experience gratitude for the privilege of being called by Jesus to work for Him, despite a sense of unworthiness to be in close relationship with Him.
- **Do:** Respond to Jesus’ call to become a fisher of men and women, children and youth, willing to leave everything to follow Him.

#### **Learning Outline:**
1. Know: Jesus Calls for Coworkers in the “Fishing” Business. 
   + **A** What makes us worthy to become coworkers with Jesus?
   + **B** Where does the power come from for bringing souls into the gospel net? How do we connect to the Source of that power?
2. Feel: Unworthy Sinners, Yet Grateful and Obedient
   + **A** In what ways do we sense our unworthiness as sinners to be in close relationship with Jesus?
   + **B** How can we express gratitude for the privilege of being called to become coworkers with Christ?
3. Do: Answering His Call
   + **A** Why is it important when we heed Christ’s call to recognize that it is His sufficiency, not our own, that will grant success in His mission?
   + **B** Why must we leave everything in order to follow Jesus and fulfill His mission for souls?
 
**Summary:** Peter’s life was dramatically transformed when he realized his true condition as a sinner in the presence of Christ. Peter rendered willing obedience to Jesus’ commands and witnessed the power of Christ to accomplish His mission independently of his skills as a professional fisherman. Peter learned that he must trust Christ’s sufficiency alone.

#### **Learning Cycle**
------

#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 14:25–33">Matthew 14:25–33</a>

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Trusting in our own sufficiency leads to danger and despair. Once Peter realizes that his only hope is in Christ and calls out to Him for help, he is able to conquer the waves of despair that threaten his life and soul. Jesus still asks of us, as He did that day of Peter, “ ‘Why did you doubt?’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 14:31">Matt. 14:31</a>, NKJV). As the disciples did, we need to respond in worship, saying, “ ‘Truly You are the Son of God’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 14:33">Matt. 14:33</a>, NKJV).

Other experiences from the life of Peter also reveal his ongoing struggle with self-sufficiency and his slowness to learn the lesson that Christ tried to teach him. Only when he is humbled and broken after his denial of Jesus is he fully converted. It is then that he submits completely to the sufficiency of Christ, ready to become an instrument in Christ’s hands for the fulfillment of His mission.

**Just for Teachers**: The goal of this lesson is to lead the class to distrust their own sufficiency and to learn to rely on Christ’s sufficiency. 

**Opening Activity and Discussion**: Have the class read <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 14:25–33">Matthew 14:25–33</a>. Discuss the setting in which this event takes place (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 14:13–24">Matt. 14:13–24</a>) and what Peter should have taken away from these events. Ask the class to consider events in their lives that have tended to lead to self-confidence. Invite them to recall how things turned out before they surrendered themselves to Christ’s leadership and power in their lives. Based on subsequent events in Peter’s life, how effectively does he learn his lesson here? How effectively do we learn the lesson of trusting Christ’s power and sufficiency in our early experiences? Why does Jesus not give up on us just because we don’t learn the first time around?

#### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**:

Several important points are developed in <a class="verse" verse="Luke 5:1–11">Luke 5:1–11</a> that need to be emphasized to the students. Whom Jesus calls He equips; the power is from Him. The men He calls are professional fishermen, but He calls them to become apprentice fishers of people, a task for which they are ill-equipped. Jesus provides the evidence that He is the professional at fishing. If those whom He calls trust in Him rather than in their own methods, He will provide them with a successful catch. They need to acknowledge His deity and their unworthiness. They also need to leave their own tools and methods behind in order to follow Him in humble obedience to His calling and equipping.

### **Bible Commentary**

1. **The Call to Service** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Luke 5:1–11">Luke 5:1–11</a> with your class.)

As a professional fisherman, Peter lives his life on the water. He knows what it takes to catch fish, or so he believes. He also knows that people don’t walk on water. Jesus overturns all of Peter’s knowledge and self-sufficiency. To catch fish effectively one needs to have power over nature. Only Jesus has that power. He demonstrates it by filling Peter’s nets with an overwhelming catch of fish after Peter toils all night without catching anything. (Later, Jesus also demonstrates His power again by walking on water.) Peter needs to recognize and acknowledge Jesus’ deity and his own unworthiness so that he might work in association with Him (<a class="verse" verse="Luke 5:8">Luke 5:8</a>). Peter also needs to learn to trust Jesus when He issues a command or instruction, because the Savior always knows exactly what He is doing and has the power to execute His own will. Peter also needs to leave behind all of his own tools and methods to follow Jesus, apprenticed to the Master Fisher of men and women (<a class="verse" verse="Luke 5:10, 11">Luke 5:10, 11</a>).

Consider This: How successful have we been at fishing for souls on our own, using purely human methods? How much more successful would we be if we trusted Christ’s methods and power, and why?

2. **The Call to Confess Christ** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 16:13–19">Matthew 16:13–19</a> with your class.)

Jesus invites His disciples to confess their awareness of His identity (“ ‘Who do you say I am?’ ” [<a class="verse" verse="Matt 16:15">Matt. 16:15</a>, NIV]). Peter, ever the brash spokesperson for the others, expresses his confession that Jesus is the Christ (Messiah), the Son of the living God (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 16:16">Matt. 16:16</a>). Jesus declares that Peter could have known this truth only by revelation from the Father (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 16:17">Matt. 16:17</a>). This acknowledgment is no credit to Peter, but it underscores the necessity for divine insight in coming to such a conclusion. Unfortunately, Peter seems to have become more confident of, and reliant on, his own correct understanding of Christ and His mission (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 16:21–23">Matt. 16:21–23</a>).

**Consider This**: How can we be certain that we know Christ’s true identity as Messiah? How can we attain a more intimate knowledge of Him and what He is able to accomplish in our lives?
 
3. **The Call to Humility** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 16:21–23">Matthew 16:21–23</a> with your class.)

As Jesus attempts to explain His mission to His disciples, Peter rebukes Jesus: “ ‘Never, Lord! . . . This shall never happen to you!’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 16:22">Matt. 16:22</a>, NIV). Peter’s self-confident attitude is sharply reproved by Jesus as being expressive of the spirit of Satan. What does Jesus mean when He says to Peter, “ ‘You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 16:23">Matt. 16:23</a>, NIV)? What does Peter seem to have in mind in his rebuke to Jesus? How can we develop a more humble, self-effacing attitude? What does <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 5:5, 6">1 Peter 5:5, 6</a> reveal that has helped Peter eventually to learn of the importance of humility?

**Consider This**: In what ways do our expectations of Jesus correspond to His own sense of identity and mission? How do we know when we are ready to learn the lesson of humility?

4. **The Call to Faithfulness** (Review together <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 26:31–35, 69–75">Matthew 26:31–35, 69–75</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Luke 22:31–34">Luke 22:31–34</a>.)

After three and a half years with Jesus, Peter still has not learned his lesson. Peter first denies Jesus’ prediction that all would forsake Him and flee, insisting that he never would do that. Then he denies Jesus Himself, insisting that he does not know Him. When Peter realizes that Jesus knows him better than he knows himself, he finally submits himself fully to God and allows God’s Spirit to control him. This full surrender results in his conversion, placing him in a position to become a spiritual leader for Jesus’ church and the writer of the two epistles that encourage others to be faithful to Jesus.

It is interesting to note that, after Peter has been active as a church leader and apostle for many years, he still exhibits some weaknesses for which he is reproved, according to Paul, in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 2:11–14">Galatians 2:11–14</a>. Ellen G. White writes concerning this incident: “Peter saw the error into which he had fallen, and immediately set about repairing the evil that had been wrought, so far as was in his power. God, who knows the end from the beginning, permitted Peter to reveal this weakness of character in order that the tried apostle might see that there was nothing in himself whereof he might boast. Even the best of men, if left to themselves, will err in judgment.”—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 198.

#### Discussion Questions: 

`How does Peter’s experience in these events of <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 26">Matthew 26</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Luke 22">Luke 22</a> prepare his understanding for writing his two epistles?`

`In what ways do we identify with Peter’s self-confidence and assertiveness? What will need to happen to us to bring our self-confidence under submission in order that we may learn at the Master’s feet?`

`What role does Jesus’ prayer for Peter (<a class="verse" verse="Luke 22:32">Luke 22:32</a>) play in his conversion? How does this prayer enable Peter to strengthen his brethren through the writing of his two epistles? How does knowing that Jesus has prayed for us (<a class="verse" verse="John 17:20">John 17:20</a>) offer us encouragement and hope?`

#### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Remind the class that Peter’s experience is not unique to him. He is just bolder and more outspoken in asserting himself in various situations than are his fellow disciples; so he receives more attention in the Gospels. None of the disciples understand what Jesus tells them about His mission (<a class="verse" verse="Luke 9:44, 45">Luke 9:44, 45</a>). Just as Elijah (<a class="verse" verse="James 5:17">James 5:17</a>), they are human beings sharing the same weaknesses that we all do and needing the same divine power for victory over those weaknesses.

**Thought Questions**: 

`What do I have in common with Peter? What is my potential for good or evil?`

`How can I be strengthened by recalling that Jesus is praying for me, so that when I am converted I can, in turn, strengthen my brothers and sisters?`

**Activity**: Have the class consider praying specifically for those in the church, including their own members who may be struggling with Satan’s temptations. Encourage one another to faithfulness.

**Alternate Activity**: Discuss with the class the call to discipleship (fishing for people) that Jesus makes to Peter, Andrew, James, and John in <a class="verse" verse="Luke 5:1–11">Luke 5:1–11</a> (compare with <a class="verse" verse="Matt 4:18–22">Matt. 4:18–22</a>). Plan a class project that would involve attracting people into the gospel net.

#### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: We have an opportunity here to relate to Peter’s life and experience. Note the ways in which Jesus reaches out to encourage Peter rather than to criticize him for his failures, even in the midst of predicting some of them. What experiences can class members cite as evidence that Jesus is there to encourage them, despite their frequent failures?

**Activity**: Create a chart, if supplies are available, of the ups and downs, the successes and failures, in Peter’s life, as recorded in the New Testament. Alternately, if supplies are not available, ask the class to list these aspects of Peter’s life. What pattern emerges? What relation does the pattern have to Peter’s conversion experience? How is this instructive for us?
