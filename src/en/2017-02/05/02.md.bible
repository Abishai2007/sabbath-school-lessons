            '1 Corinthians 12:1–26': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 12:1-26</span></h3><p><span><span>12&#xA0;</span>Now concerning spiritual <i>gifts,</i> brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant: </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, however you were led. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit <i>of all:</i> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another <i>different</i> kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also <i>is</i> Christ. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body&#x2014;whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free&#x2014;and have all been made to drink into one Spirit. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For in fact the body is not one member but many.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>If the foot should say, &#x201C;Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body,&#x201D; is it therefore not of the body? </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And if the ear should say, &#x201C;Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body,&#x201D; is it therefore not of the body? </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>If the whole body <i>were</i> an eye, where <i>would be</i> the hearing? If the whole <i>were</i> hearing, where <i>would be</i> the smelling? </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He pleased. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And if they were all one member, where <i>would</i> the body <i>be?</i></span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>But now indeed <i>there are</i> many members, yet one body. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And the eye cannot say to the hand, &#x201C;I have no need of you&#x201D;; nor again the head to the feet, &#x201C;I have no need of you.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And those <i>members</i> of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable <i>parts</i> have greater modesty, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>but our presentable <i>parts</i> have no need. But God composed the body, having given greater honor to that <i>part</i> which lacks it, </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>that there should be no schism in the body, but <i>that</i> the members should have the same care for one another. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with <i>it;</i> or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with <i>it.</i></span></p>'

But when you do good and suffer, if you take it patiently, this <i>is</i> commendable before God. </span> </p><h3> <span>1 Peter 2:21</span></h3><p> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:</span></p>'

### Being of “One Mind” 

`Read <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 3:8–12">1 Peter 3:8–12</a>. What point is Peter making here about how Christians should live? What does he repeat that he already wrote about in <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 2:20, 21">1 Peter 2:20, 21</a>?` 

Peter starts out telling them all to be of “one mind” (homophrones). He’s not talking about uniformity, in the sense of everyone having to think, do, and believe exactly the same way. The best example of this idea is found in <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 12:1–26">1 Corinthians 12:1–26</a>. In these verses, Paul points out that the body is made up of parts. There are hands and eyes, but still together each part makes up the whole body. In the same way, the church is made up of individuals with different spiritual gifts. But all believers are joined together with the same purpose and spirit. They work together to form a united community. 

Of course, such unity is not always so easy to achieve. The history of the Christian church sadly has shown this fact to be true all too often. So Peter warns believers against not agreeing with one another. Then he tells his readers how they can show this Christian ideal of being united.

For example, Christians should act with sympathy (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 3:8">1 Pet. 3:8</a>). Sympathy means that when one Christian suffers, then others will suffer with him or her; when another Christian rejoices, other Christians will rejoice with him or her (compare <a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 12:26">1 Cor. 12:26</a>). Sympathy enables us to see the perspective of others, an important step along the way to unity. Peter then says we should “love one another” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 3:8">1 Pet. 3:8</a>, NIV). Jesus Himself said that the way you can recognize His true disciples is that they love one another (<a class="verse" verse="John 13:35">John 13:35</a>). Furthermore, Peter says that Christians will have a tender heart (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 3:8">1 Pet. 3:8</a>). They will have compassion for one another’s difficulties and failings. 

“Crucify self; esteem others better than yourselves. Thus you will be brought into oneness with Christ. Before the heavenly universe, and before the church and the world, you will bear unmistakable evidence that you are God’s sons and daughters. God will be glorified in the example that you set.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 188.  

`How often do we do what Peter says here, especially the part about “not returning evil for evil” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 3:9">1 Pet. 3:9</a>, NKJV)? What kind of death to self must we experience in order to follow these words? How can we have that kind of death? (See <a class="verse" verse="Gal 2:20">Gal. 2:20</a>.)`
