            '1 Pet 4:1, 2': '<h3> <span>1 Peter 4:1</span></h3><p><span><span>4&#xA0;</span>Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind, for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, </span> </p><h3> <span>1 Peter 4:2</span></h3><p> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>that he no longer should live the rest of <i>his</i> time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God. </span> </p>'
            '1 Pet 4:3–11': '<h3> <span>1 Peter 4:3-11</span></h3><p> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For we <i>have spent</i> enough of our past lifetime in doing the will of the Gentiles&#x2014;when we walked in lewdness, lusts, drunkenness, revelries, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>In regard to these, they think it strange that you do not run with <i>them</i> in the same flood of dissipation, speaking evil of <i>you.</i> </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>They will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>For this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>But the end of all things is at hand; therefore be serious and watchful in your prayers. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And above all things have fervent love for one another, for <span>&#x201C;love will cover a multitude of sins.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup><i>Be</i> hospitable to one another without grumbling. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>As each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>If anyone speaks, <i>let him speak</i> as the oracles of God. If anyone ministers, <i>let him do it</i> as with the ability which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</span></p>'
            '1 Peter 3:12': '<h3> <span>1 Peter 3:12</span></h3><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup><span>For the eyes of the L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span> <i>are</i> on the righteous,</span></span><br><span><span>And His ears</span> <i>are open</i> <span>to their prayers;</span></span><br><span><span>But the face of the L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span> <i>is</i> against those who do evil.&#x201D;</span></span></p>'
            'Rom 6:1–11': '<h3> <span>Romans 6:1-11</span></h3><p><span><span>6&#xA0;</span>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it? </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be <i>in the likeness</i> of <i>His</i> resurrection, </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>knowing this, that our old man was crucified with <i>Him,</i> that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>For he who has died has been freed from sin. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For <i>the death</i> that He died, He died to sin once for all; but <i>the life</i> that He lives, He lives to God. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></p>'
            '2 Sam 11:4': '<h3> <span>2 Samuel 11:4</span></h3><p> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Then David sent messengers, and took her; and she came to him, and he lay with her, for she was cleansed from her impurity; and she returned to her house. </span> </p>'
            '1 Tim 1:15': '<h3> <span>1 Timothy 1:15</span></h3><p> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>This <i>is</i> a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief. </span> </p>'
            '1 Pet 4:1': '<h3> <span>1 Peter 4:1</span></h3><p><span><span>4&#xA0;</span>Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind, for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, </span> </p>'

### Living for God

### Read for This Week’s Study
<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 3:8–12">1 Pet. 3:8–12</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Gal 2:20">Gal. 2:20</a>; <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 4:1, 2">1 Pet. 4:1, 2</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Rom 6:1–11">Rom. 6:1–11</a>; <a class="verse" verse="2 Sam 11:4">2 Sam. 11:4</a>; <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 4:3–11">1 Pet. 4:3–11</a>.

> <p>Memory Text</p>
> “ ‘For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 3:12">1 Peter 3:12</a>, NKJV).

The Bible writers knew the reality of human sinfulness. How could they not? The world reeks of it. Besides, they knew their own sinfulness, as well (see <a class="verse" verse="1 Tim 1:15">1 Tim. 1:15</a>). They knew just how serious it was, too; after all, look at what it took—the cross of Jesus Christ—to solve the problem of sin. That’s how deep and pervasive the reality of sin really is.

But the Bible writers also were greatly aware of the power of Christ to change our lives and make us new people in Him. 

This week, Peter continues on this same track: the kind of new life that Christians will have in Christ after they have given themselves to Him and have been baptized. In fact, the change will be so great that others will notice it. Peter doesn’t say that this change will always be easy; indeed, he talks about the need to suffer in the flesh (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 4:1">1 Pet. 4:1</a>) in order to have the victory that we are promised. 

Peter continues a theme that pervades the Bible, the reality of love in the life of a believer in Jesus. “Love,” he writes, “will cover a multitude of sins” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 4:8">1 Pet. 4:8</a>, NKJV). When we love, when we forgive, we are reflecting what Jesus has done and still does for us.
