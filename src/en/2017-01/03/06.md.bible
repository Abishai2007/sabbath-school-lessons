### The Importance of His Divinity 

What would be lost if the Holy Spirit were not God? If the Holy Spirit is not fully God, the implications for salvation and worship are serious. The Bible tells us that the Holy Spirit is responsible for regenerating believers. He dwells in us and fills us. He renews our thinking and changes our characters. He has the power to resurrect. He makes Christ’s followers as God is: holy. If the Holy Spirit is not God, how can we be certain that He can do any of these things and do them in such a way that they are acceptable to God? 

`Read <a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 1:2">1 Peter 1:2</a>; <a class="verse" verse="2 Corinthians 13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</a>; and <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 28:18, 19">Matthew 28:18, 19</a>. What does the fact that the Holy Spirit is mentioned side by side with God the Father, and Jesus Christ, the Son, in baptism and benedictions tell us about the place of the Holy Spirit in the adoration and worship of God?` 

The divinity of the Holy Spirit helps us to relate to Him in appropriate ways that acknowledge Him for who He truly is. His divinity is the presupposition for a God-centered spirituality. The New Testament church without hesitation mentions the Holy Spirit side by side with the other two members of the Godhead. The Holy Spirit occupies the same rank and position in the act of baptism as do the Father and the Son. Baptism has a deep spiritual significance and is an ordinance of profound worship. What is true in the act of baptism is equally true of the apostolic benediction. It is an invocation of adoration where the Holy Spirit is praised just as are the Father and the Son. All three persons of the Godhead are mentioned side by side and are affirmed equally.

The Holy Spirit is affirmed as a proper object of worship in the New Testament, not just in baptism and in the apostolic benediction but also in the constant requirement that we depend on Him for all spiritual good and should obey Him as our divine teacher and sanctifier. Does it matter that the Holy Spirit is God? Yes, very much so. If we know who He truly is, and recognize and acknowledge His deity, we will honor His work and rely on Him for our own personal growth and sanctification. 

`Think about what it means that the Holy Spirit, God Himself, is working in your life. What great promises are found here for us in knowing that it is God who is working in us to change us into what we can be in Him? Why is this an uplifting and affirming truth?`

  <p>Dear brothers and sisters,</p>

  <p>With great disappointment I would like to inform that Portuguese Publishing House (Publicadora SerVir) reached out to us and threatened with legal sanctions if we keep providing Portuguese Sabbath School lessons in our application.</p>

  <p>It is extremely sad that too witness our own church entities doing it. But it is the reality of the world we live in, and has been prophesied long time ago (Ephesians 6:12) – and many of our church leaders are blind to the true evangelism and has only one focus – money. Greed has overtaken their minds and conscience and it is not anything new, as it has been seen before (Matthew 21:12).</p>

  <p>Mission of Adventech ministry is to glorify God through technology.</p>
  <p>Mission of Adventech is to unite our Adventist church through technology.</p>
  <p>Mission of Adventech is to use technology to bring Good News to this world and see Jesus Coming Again!</p>

  <p>To date, our Sabbath School application is providing lessons in English, Spanish, German, French, Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and Japanese. It has over 300 000 installations. It is completely free of charge and that will never change. It is completely ad free and that will never change. Lesson is never modified from its source and that will never change. Adventech will continue doing everything possible to help brothers and sisters around the world read, study use Sabbath School. We will continue adding more languages to our application. We will continue to add more functionality and improve usability. Adventech will continue bringing talent together to create, innovate and deliver. Adventech will be building more applications!</p>

  <p>At this point Adventech ministry and me personally are praying for the guidance of the Holy Spirit, for if God is for us, who can be against us? (Romans 8:31). We do not support revolution or anything like that, but rely on God only – Romans 12:19. It is possible that more publishing houses will take path similar to Publicadora SerVir and Casa Publicadora Brasiliera – and try to stop our ministry.</p>

  <p>Because of that: we ask for your support in prayers! We ask for your support in prayers with your pastors! We ask for your support in prayers with your friends! We ask for your support in prayers with church leaders! We ask for your support in prayers for above mentioned publishing houses! We ask for your support in prayers to Jesus Christ!</p>

  <p>May God bless you all for the support.</p>
