### The Holy Spirit’s Divine Attributes

In several biblical passages, the Holy Spirit is described as having divine attributes.

What attributes and activities of the Holy Spirit are listed in the following Bible passages that, otherwise, can be attributed only to God?

`<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 2:10, 11">1 Cor. 2:10, 11</a>; compare with <a class="verse" verse="Isa 40:13, 14">Isa. 40:13, 14</a>` 

`<a class="verse" verse="Ps 139:7">Ps. 139:7</a>`

`<a class="verse" verse="Heb 9:14">Heb. 9:14</a>; compare with <a class="verse" verse="1 Tim 6:16">1 Tim. 6:16</a>`

`<a class="verse" verse="Luke 1:35">Luke 1:35</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Rom 15:19">Rom. 15:19</a>; compare with <a class="verse" verse="Ps 104:30">Ps. 104:30</a>`

In his examination of the wisdom of God, Paul argues that it is the Holy Spirit who makes this wisdom known to us. “Like knows like” is the reasoning Paul employs here in his argument. Only One who is equal to God can know the deep things of God (<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 2:10, 11">1 Cor. 2:10, 11</a>). There is no knowing God as does the Spirit, for He knows God from the inside. He knows in a way that an outsider does not. The Holy Spirit is indeed omniscient. 

The presence of the Spirit is the presence of God. If I cannot flee to a place where the Spirit of God is not, He is omnipresent (compare with <a class="verse" verse="Ps 139:7">Ps. 139:7</a>). 

The Holy Spirit is said to be eternal (<a class="verse" verse="Heb 9:14">Heb. 9:14</a>). According to the Bible, how many eternal beings are there? Only God is eternal (<a class="verse" verse="1 Tim 6:16">1 Tim. 6:16</a>). If the Spirit is called eternal, then He must be God. 

The Holy Spirit also is all-powerful or almighty. In <a class="verse" verse="Luke 1:35">Luke 1:35</a> the phrases “the Holy Spirit” and “the power of the most High” (NASB) are synonymous constructions. Here they refer to a miracle of the first magnitude, the virgin conception. In <a class="verse" verse="Romans 15:19">Romans 15:19</a>, the apostle Paul acknowledges that his ministry was achieved by “mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God” (NKJV). Indeed, the Holy Spirit can do divine miracles. 

Jesus also says that blasphemy against the Spirit is unforgivable (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 12:31, 32">Matt. 12:31, 32</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Mark 3:28, 29">Mark 3:28, 29</a>). This is incomprehensible unless the Spirit is divine. 

But perhaps the most amazing work of the Holy Spirit is His ability to change human hearts and minds. It is the Holy Spirit who accomplishes a new spiritual birth (<a class="verse" verse="John 3:5–8">John 3:5–8</a>). He has the power to accomplish something that only God can do.

  <p>Dear brothers and sisters,</p>

  <p>With great disappointment I would like to inform that Portuguese Publishing House (Publicadora SerVir) reached out to us and threatened with legal sanctions if we keep providing Portuguese Sabbath School lessons in our application.</p>

  <p>It is extremely sad that too witness our own church entities doing it. But it is the reality of the world we live in, and has been prophesied long time ago (Ephesians 6:12) – and many of our church leaders are blind to the true evangelism and has only one focus – money. Greed has overtaken their minds and conscience and it is not anything new, as it has been seen before (Matthew 21:12).</p>

  <p>Mission of Adventech ministry is to glorify God through technology.</p>
  <p>Mission of Adventech is to unite our Adventist church through technology.</p>
  <p>Mission of Adventech is to use technology to bring Good News to this world and see Jesus Coming Again!</p>

  <p>To date, our Sabbath School application is providing lessons in English, Spanish, German, French, Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and Japanese. It has over 300 000 installations. It is completely free of charge and that will never change. It is completely ad free and that will never change. Lesson is never modified from its source and that will never change. Adventech will continue doing everything possible to help brothers and sisters around the world read, study use Sabbath School. We will continue adding more languages to our application. We will continue to add more functionality and improve usability. Adventech will continue bringing talent together to create, innovate and deliver. Adventech will be building more applications!</p>

  <p>At this point Adventech ministry and me personally are praying for the guidance of the Holy Spirit, for if God is for us, who can be against us? (Romans 8:31). We do not support revolution or anything like that, but rely on God only – Romans 12:19. It is possible that more publishing houses will take path similar to Publicadora SerVir and Casa Publicadora Brasiliera – and try to stop our ministry.</p>

  <p>Because of that: we ask for your support in prayers! We ask for your support in prayers with your pastors! We ask for your support in prayers with your friends! We ask for your support in prayers with church leaders! We ask for your support in prayers for above mentioned publishing houses! We ask for your support in prayers to Jesus Christ!</p>

  <p>May God bless you all for the support.</p>
