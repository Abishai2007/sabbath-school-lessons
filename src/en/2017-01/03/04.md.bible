### Biblical Hints 

There are various references to the Holy Spirit in the Bible that are interchangeable with references to God.

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Isaiah 63:10–14">Isaiah 63:10–14</a> and compare it with <a class="verse" verse="Numbers 14:11">Numbers 14:11</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Deuteronomy 32:12">Deuteronomy 32:12</a>. To whom was the writer referring in these passages, and what does this tell us about the divinity of the Holy Spirit?`

In <a class="verse" verse="Isaiah 63:10">Isaiah 63:10</a>, the people rebelled and grieved the Holy Spirit. However, the parallel account, as found in <a class="verse" verse="Numbers 14:11">Numbers 14:11</a>, states that “the Lord said to Moses, ‘How long will this people spurn me?’ ” (NASB). And in <a class="verse" verse="Deuteronomy 32:12">Deuteronomy 32:12</a>, we are told that “ ‘the Lord alone guided him, and there was no foreign god with him’ ” (NASB). Obviously the biblical writers saw God and the Holy Spirit on par with each other. 

In <a class="verse" verse="2 Samuel 23:2">2 Samuel 23:2</a>, we read that “ ‘the Spirit of the Lord spoke by me’ ” (NASB), whereas in the parallel statement in <a class="verse" verse="2 Samuel 23:3">2 Samuel 23:3</a>, it says: “ ‘The God of Israel said . . . to me’ ” (NASB). Again, the conclusion from this biblical parallel is that the Holy Spirit is considered to be equal to God.

`Compare <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 3:16, 17">1 Corinthians 3:16, 17</a> with <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 6:19, 20">1 Corinthians 6:19, 20</a>, and compare <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 12:11">1 Corinthians 12:11</a> with <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>. How are the references to the Holy Spirit and to God used interchangeably in these passages? What is attributed to God and to the Holy Spirit alike?`

In <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 3:16, 17">1 Corinthians 3:16, 17</a>, Paul uses similar language as in <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 6:19, 20">1 Corinthians 6:19, 20</a>. For the apostle Paul, to be indwelt by the Holy Spirit is to be inhabited by God. By equating the expression “God’s temple” (NIV) with a temple “of the Holy Spirit” (NIV), Paul points out that the Holy Spirit is God.

In <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 12:11">1 Corinthians 12:11</a>, Paul writes that it is the Holy Spirit who distributes the spiritual gifts to each believer. A few verses later in 

<a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>, we are told that it is God who is doing it. The basic message is clear: the Holy Spirit does the same action as God is doing, powerful evidence that the Holy Spirit is equal to God.

`Read again <a class="verse" verse="Numbers 14:11">Numbers 14:11</a>. In what ways might this be applied to us today? Think about the miraculous ways God has worked in our church. Think about all the reasons He has given us to believe. How can we make sure we aren’t doing today what God’s people did thousands of years ago?`

  <p>Dear brothers and sisters,</p>

  <p>With great disappointment I would like to inform that Portuguese Publishing House (Publicadora SerVir) reached out to us and threatened with legal sanctions if we keep providing Portuguese Sabbath School lessons in our application.</p>

  <p>It is extremely sad that too witness our own church entities doing it. But it is the reality of the world we live in, and has been prophesied long time ago (Ephesians 6:12) – and many of our church leaders are blind to the true evangelism and has only one focus – money. Greed has overtaken their minds and conscience and it is not anything new, as it has been seen before (Matthew 21:12).</p>

  <p>Mission of Adventech ministry is to glorify God through technology.</p>
  <p>Mission of Adventech is to unite our Adventist church through technology.</p>
  <p>Mission of Adventech is to use technology to bring Good News to this world and see Jesus Coming Again!</p>

  <p>To date, our Sabbath School application is providing lessons in English, Spanish, German, French, Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and Japanese. It has over 300 000 installations. It is completely free of charge and that will never change. It is completely ad free and that will never change. Lesson is never modified from its source and that will never change. Adventech will continue doing everything possible to help brothers and sisters around the world read, study use Sabbath School. We will continue adding more languages to our application. We will continue to add more functionality and improve usability. Adventech will continue bringing talent together to create, innovate and deliver. Adventech will be building more applications!</p>

  <p>At this point Adventech ministry and me personally are praying for the guidance of the Holy Spirit, for if God is for us, who can be against us? (Romans 8:31). We do not support revolution or anything like that, but rely on God only – Romans 12:19. It is possible that more publishing houses will take path similar to Publicadora SerVir and Casa Publicadora Brasiliera – and try to stop our ministry.</p>

  <p>Because of that: we ask for your support in prayers! We ask for your support in prayers with your pastors! We ask for your support in prayers with your friends! We ask for your support in prayers with church leaders! We ask for your support in prayers for above mentioned publishing houses! We ask for your support in prayers to Jesus Christ!</p>

  <p>May God bless you all for the support.</p>
