        verses:
            'Galatians 5:22, 23': '<h3> <span>Galatians 5:22</span></h3><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, </span> </p><h3> <span>Galatians 5:23</span></h3><p> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. </span> </p>'
            '1 Corinthians 13': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 13</span></h3><p><span><span>13&#xA0;</span>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And though I have <i>the gift of</i> prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And though I bestow all my goods to feed <i>the poor,</i> and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Love suffers long <i>and</i> is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Love never fails. But whether <i>there are</i> prophecies, they will fail; whether <i>there are</i> tongues, they will cease; whether <i>there is</i> knowledge, it will vanish away. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>For we know in part and we prophesy in part. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these <i>is</i> love.</span></p>'
            'John 15:1–11': '<h3> <span>John 15:1-11</span></h3><p><span><span>15&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser.</span> </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup><span>Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away;</span><span> and every <i>branch</i> that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit.</span> </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup><span>You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.</span> </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup><span>Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me.</span></span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;I am the vine, you <i>are</i> the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.</span> </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup><span>If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw <i>them</i> into the fire, and they are burned.</span> </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup><span>If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will</span><span> ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.</span> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup><span>By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples.</span></span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love.</span> </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup><span>If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father&#x2019;s commandments and abide in His love.</span></span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and <i>that</i> your joy may be full.</span> </span> </p>'
            'Rom 14:17': '<h3> <span>Romans 14:17</span></h3><p> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. </span> </p>'
            'Gal 5:22': '<h3> <span>Galatians 5:22</span></h3><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, </span> </p>'
            'Matt 5:5': '<h3> <span>Matthew 5:5</span></h3><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup><span>Blessed <i>are</i> the meek,</span></span><br><span><span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><span><span>For they shall inherit the earth.</span></span></span></p>'

### The Holy Spirit and the Fruit of the Spirit

### Read for This Week’s Study
<a class="verse" verse="John 15:1–11">John 15:1–11</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Gal 5:22">Gal. 5:22</a>, <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 13">1 Corinthians 13</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Rom 14:17">Rom. 14:17</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Eph 5:9">Eph. 5:9</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Matt 5:5">Matt. 5:5</a>.

> <p>Memory Text</p>
> “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law” (<a class="verse" verse="Galatians 5:22, 23">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>, NASB). 

The fruit of the Spirit is the true essence of the Christian life. While the apostle Paul lists nine different aspects of this fruit, it is nevertheless one fruit and has to be seen in its entirety. The fruit of the Spirit does not tell us what a person might be able to do for God through spiritual gifts and talents. Rather, it shows how the person lives for God. It tells who the person is. All the virtues that are listed in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 5:22, 23">Galatians 5:22, 23</a> are present in Jesus Christ. Hence, the fruit of the Spirit is the life of Jesus Christ in us, made possible through the power of the Holy Spirit.

The fruit of the Spirit is not something we achieve by purely human effort. It is possible to produce and display some of the same virtues through the exercise of our willpower. But that is not the same as what the Holy Spirit does in us. What we produce ourselves is like a wax fruit compared to the real. Wax fruits are artificial. From a distance they look just as beautiful, but the taste is immeasurably inferior to the real. Real fruit is not manufactured. It grows out of a relationship. When the Holy Spirit connects us with Jesus, through His Written Word, His characteristics begin to reveal themselves in our own lives.
