            '1 Corinthians 13': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 13</span></h3><p><span><span>13&#xA0;</span>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And though I have <i>the gift of</i> prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And though I bestow all my goods to feed <i>the poor,</i> and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Love suffers long <i>and</i> is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Love never fails. But whether <i>there are</i> prophecies, they will fail; whether <i>there are</i> tongues, they will cease; whether <i>there is</i> knowledge, it will vanish away. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>For we know in part and we prophesy in part. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these <i>is</i> love.</span></p>'

### The Fruit of Love

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 5:22">Galatians 5:22</a> and <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 13">1 Corinthians 13</a>. Why is love the first and foremost aspect of the fruit of the Spirit? How does love affect all the following aspects of this fruit?`

Love appropriately leads and crowns the various characteristics of the fruit of the Spirit and permeates the whole fruit. In a sense all other qualities listed can be seen as aspects of love. Because God is love (<a class="verse" verse="1 John 4:8">1 John 4:8</a>), the greatest Christian virtue is love (<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 13:13">1 Cor. 13:13</a>). God’s love is the foundation and source of every other goodness. God’s love is poured out to us within our hearts through the Holy Spirit (<a class="verse" verse="Rom 5:5">Rom. 5:5</a>). Love is the evidence that we are God’s children. 

This love is far more than mere human affection. It cannot be produced by human effort. It comes as a result of abiding in Christ. Such love is generous and unmerited. It alone has the power to transform. In its tender yet strong nature, divine love leads the sinner to repentance and awakens the desire for something better. Love has the power to unite—even those who formerly were enemies (<a class="verse" verse="Luke 6:27, 28">Luke 6:27, 28</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Rom 5:8">Rom. 5:8</a>). Thus, by our love for each other the world will know that Christians are indeed followers of Jesus Christ (<a class="verse" verse="John 13:35">John 13:35</a>). This fruit of love will also lead Christians to manifest understanding and sensitivity toward others. 

It is interesting that the master description of love in <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 13">1 Corinthians 13</a> comes right between chapters 12 and 14. Those two chapters deal with the gifts of the Spirit. Chapter 13, however, deals with love: the fruit of the Spirit. Even the superior gifts are nothing without love. The gifts of the Spirit without the fruit of the Spirit are powerless and do not produce the blessing that God intends. Love, however, is the glue that binds all other virtues of the fruit of the Spirit into a united whole and gives authenticity to everything we do.

`Where does your life lack the quality of love? Ask the Holy Spirit to fill you with love toward those people with whom you are dealing on a daily basis. Remember that God also loves us through other people. How can you show others love? How does love affect those other virtues mentioned in the fruit of the Spirit?`
