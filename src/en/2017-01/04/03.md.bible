### Personal Aspects of the Holy Spirit: Part 1

`As you read the following texts, ask yourself if they sound as if they are talking about an impersonal force or about a divine Person. <a class="verse" verse="Rom 8:14–16, 27; 15:30">Rom. 8:14–16, 27; 15:30</a>; <a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 2:10">1 Cor. 2:10</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Acts 8:29; 10:19, 20; 28:25">Acts 8:29; 10:19, 20; 28:25</a>.`

Can an impersonal force intercede in our behalf ? Does an impersonal spirit or power have the ability to reveal to us things about God? Does an impersonal influence have the ability to speak? All those biblical statements make much more sense if the Holy Spirit is a personal being as opposed to some impersonal force. 

`Read the following texts. What personal attributes are ascribed to the Holy Spirit in these passages? <a class="verse" verse="Eph 4:30">Eph. 4:30</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Acts 5:3, 9">Acts 5:3, 9</a>; <a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 12:11">1 Cor. 12:11</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Rom 15:30">Rom. 15:30</a>.`

The distinctive characteristics of personality are knowledge (or understanding), feeling, and will. Only a personal being can be grieved. Only a personal being can be deceived and lied to. Only a personal being has the ability to choose as he wills and has his own volition. The will is perhaps one of the most distinctive elements and characteristics in any personality. And only a personal being has the capacity to love. True love is not conceivable in an abstract and impersonal manner. Love comes with a very personal touch. These predicates of personality indicate that the Holy Spirit is a self-conscious, self-knowing, self-willing, and self-determining Being, capable of love. He is not a shadowy effluence or an impersonal essence. The Holy Spirit is spoken of in these personal ways because God Himself is a personal God. 

“The Holy Spirit has a personality, else He could not bear witness to our spirits and with our spirits that we are the children of God. He must also be a divine person, else He could not search out the secrets which lie hidden in the mind of God.”—Ellen G. White, Evangelism, p. 617.

`How does the biblical perspective that the Holy Spirit has characteristics of a personality impact our relationship with Him? What would be different if the Holy Spirit were just an impersonal power as opposed to God Himself?`

  <p>Dear brothers and sisters,</p>

  <p>With great disappointment I would like to inform that Portuguese Publishing House (Publicadora SerVir) reached out to us and threatened with legal sanctions if we keep providing Portuguese Sabbath School lessons in our application.</p>

  <p>It is extremely sad that too witness our own church entities doing it. But it is the reality of the world we live in, and has been prophesied long time ago (Ephesians 6:12) – and many of our church leaders are blind to the true evangelism and has only one focus – money. Greed has overtaken their minds and conscience and it is not anything new, as it has been seen before (Matthew 21:12).</p>

  <p>Mission of Adventech ministry is to glorify God through technology.</p>
  <p>Mission of Adventech is to unite our Adventist church through technology.</p>
  <p>Mission of Adventech is to use technology to bring Good News to this world and see Jesus Coming Again!</p>

  <p>To date, our Sabbath School application is providing lessons in English, Spanish, German, French, Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and Japanese. It has over 300 000 installations. It is completely free of charge and that will never change. It is completely ad free and that will never change. Lesson is never modified from its source and that will never change. Adventech will continue doing everything possible to help brothers and sisters around the world read, study use Sabbath School. We will continue adding more languages to our application. We will continue to add more functionality and improve usability. Adventech will continue bringing talent together to create, innovate and deliver. Adventech will be building more applications!</p>

  <p>At this point Adventech ministry and me personally are praying for the guidance of the Holy Spirit, for if God is for us, who can be against us? (Romans 8:31). We do not support revolution or anything like that, but rely on God only – Romans 12:19. It is possible that more publishing houses will take path similar to Publicadora SerVir and Casa Publicadora Brasiliera – and try to stop our ministry.</p>

  <p>Because of that: we ask for your support in prayers! We ask for your support in prayers with your pastors! We ask for your support in prayers with your friends! We ask for your support in prayers with church leaders! We ask for your support in prayers for above mentioned publishing houses! We ask for your support in prayers to Jesus Christ!</p>

  <p>May God bless you all for the support.</p>
