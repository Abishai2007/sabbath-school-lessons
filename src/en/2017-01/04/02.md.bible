### Jesus’ Description of the Holy Spirit 

`Read <a class="verse" verse="John 16:13, 14">John 16:13, 14</a>; <a class="verse" verse="John 15:26, 27">John 15:26, 27</a>; and <a class="verse" verse="John 14:17, 26">John 14:17, 26</a>. What very personal characteristics does Jesus attribute to the Holy Spirit in these passages? What does it mean to you that Jesus describes the Holy Spirit as a Helper or Comforter (parakletos)?`

According to Jesus, the Holy Spirit guides, speaks, hears, discloses, and glorifies (<a class="verse" verse="John 16:13, 14">John 16:13, 14</a>, NASB). The Holy Spirit also teaches and reminds us (<a class="verse" verse="John 14:26">John 14:26</a>). He dwells in us (<a class="verse" verse="John 14:17">John 14:17</a>), He testifies (<a class="verse" verse="John 15:24, 26">John 15:24, 26</a>), and He convicts (<a class="verse" verse="John 16:8">John 16:8</a>). These sound more like the actions of a sovereign personality than they do an impersonal force.

`Read <a class="verse" verse="John 14:16–18">John 14:16–18</a>. How would Jesus’ promise be fulfilled? How are the disciples not left alone?` 

Jesus cares for His followers. He would not leave His disciples as orphans. He promised to send the Holy Spirit. Jesus here specifically says that He will send “another helper” or “comforter.” The words that Jesus uses here are significant. He promises to send another helper. Not a different one. The Greek word for “another” is allos. In the Greek language of the New Testament, allos indicates that Christ will send another comforter who is numerically distinct but is of the same character; that is, who is similar to Himself. In other words, Jesus promises One like Himself, One who will take His place, One who will continue to do His work in us, and who is His representative. 

This work of the Holy Spirit is the work of a helper or comforter. The Bible here uses the Greek word parakletos (<a class="verse" verse="John 14:16">John 14:16</a>) to describe someone who is called upon for support, for assistance—someone called to our aid. Just as Jesus is a Person, the Holy Spirit is also personal. This idea is supported by the fact that personal attributes are often ascribed to the Holy Spirit (see <a class="verse" verse="John 14:26, 15:26">John 14:26, 15:26</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Acts 15:28">Acts 15:28</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Rom 8:26">Rom. 8:26</a>, <a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 12:11">1 Cor. 12:11</a>, <a class="verse" verse="1 Tim 4:1">1 Tim. 4:1</a>). 

`Why is it so much more comforting to know that the Holy Spirit is a personality instead of a mere force?`

  <p>Dear brothers and sisters,</p>

  <p>With great disappointment I would like to inform that Portuguese Publishing House (Publicadora SerVir) reached out to us and threatened with legal sanctions if we keep providing Portuguese Sabbath School lessons in our application.</p>

  <p>It is extremely sad that too witness our own church entities doing it. But it is the reality of the world we live in, and has been prophesied long time ago (Ephesians 6:12) – and many of our church leaders are blind to the true evangelism and has only one focus – money. Greed has overtaken their minds and conscience and it is not anything new, as it has been seen before (Matthew 21:12).</p>

  <p>Mission of Adventech ministry is to glorify God through technology.</p>
  <p>Mission of Adventech is to unite our Adventist church through technology.</p>
  <p>Mission of Adventech is to use technology to bring Good News to this world and see Jesus Coming Again!</p>

  <p>To date, our Sabbath School application is providing lessons in English, Spanish, German, French, Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and Japanese. It has over 300 000 installations. It is completely free of charge and that will never change. It is completely ad free and that will never change. Lesson is never modified from its source and that will never change. Adventech will continue doing everything possible to help brothers and sisters around the world read, study use Sabbath School. We will continue adding more languages to our application. We will continue to add more functionality and improve usability. Adventech will continue bringing talent together to create, innovate and deliver. Adventech will be building more applications!</p>

  <p>At this point Adventech ministry and me personally are praying for the guidance of the Holy Spirit, for if God is for us, who can be against us? (Romans 8:31). We do not support revolution or anything like that, but rely on God only – Romans 12:19. It is possible that more publishing houses will take path similar to Publicadora SerVir and Casa Publicadora Brasiliera – and try to stop our ministry.</p>

  <p>Because of that: we ask for your support in prayers! We ask for your support in prayers with your pastors! We ask for your support in prayers with your friends! We ask for your support in prayers with church leaders! We ask for your support in prayers for above mentioned publishing houses! We ask for your support in prayers to Jesus Christ!</p>

  <p>May God bless you all for the support.</p>
