#### Further Thought

Read Ellen G. White, “Let Not Your Heart Be Troubled,” pp. 669–672, in The Desire of Ages, where she speaks about the Holy Spirit. Also read “Dealing With False Science, Cults, Isms, and Secret Societies,” pp. 613–617, in Evangelism.

“And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, ‘All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 28:18–20">Matt. 28:18–20</a>, NKJV). Notice, as Jesus gave them their calling and work, He said to baptize disciples in the “name,” singular, of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He didn’t say “names” of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but just “name” (Greek onoma). This is more powerful proof of the triune nature of our One God (“ ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one!’ ” [<a class="verse" verse="Deut 6:4">Deut. 6:4</a>, NKJV]). As this week’s lesson has already pointed out, no one questions the personality of the Father and the Son; thus, why should anyone do that with the personality and personhood of the Holy Spirit? According to the Bible, we have the loving, caring, and comforting presence of God Himself working in us and through us. That’s who the Holy Spirit is and what He does. And how much nicer it is to know that this abiding presence is a Person, just as much as the Father and Jesus are. Yes, it’s hard to fully understand. But so what? If we can’t fully understand the nature of something as basic as light or wind, how much more so will we not be able to fully understand the nature of the Holy Spirit Himself ?

#### Discussion Questions:

`In class, go over your answer to Wednesday’s question about truth being a Person, Jesus Christ. What does that mean? Why would Jesus be the Truth? How do we understand “truth” that way—instead of seeing it merely as precepts or propositions?`

`Ellen G. White wrote: “We need to realize that the Holy Spirit, who is as much a person as God is a person, is walking through these grounds.”—Evangelism, p. 616. What does this tell us about the reality and presence of the Holy Spirit?`

`Go back over some of the traits and characteristics of the Holy Spirit that we have seen this week. Which ones are especially comforting to you? Which one means the most to you? Share in class why you chose what you did.`

`What can you better relate to, an impersonal force or a personality? What are the implications of your answer?`

  <p>Dear brothers and sisters,</p>

  <p>With great disappointment I would like to inform that Portuguese Publishing House (Publicadora SerVir) reached out to us and threatened with legal sanctions if we keep providing Portuguese Sabbath School lessons in our application.</p>

  <p>It is extremely sad that too witness our own church entities doing it. But it is the reality of the world we live in, and has been prophesied long time ago (Ephesians 6:12) – and many of our church leaders are blind to the true evangelism and has only one focus – money. Greed has overtaken their minds and conscience and it is not anything new, as it has been seen before (Matthew 21:12).</p>

  <p>Mission of Adventech ministry is to glorify God through technology.</p>
  <p>Mission of Adventech is to unite our Adventist church through technology.</p>
  <p>Mission of Adventech is to use technology to bring Good News to this world and see Jesus Coming Again!</p>

  <p>To date, our Sabbath School application is providing lessons in English, Spanish, German, French, Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and Japanese. It has over 300 000 installations. It is completely free of charge and that will never change. It is completely ad free and that will never change. Lesson is never modified from its source and that will never change. Adventech will continue doing everything possible to help brothers and sisters around the world read, study use Sabbath School. We will continue adding more languages to our application. We will continue to add more functionality and improve usability. Adventech will continue bringing talent together to create, innovate and deliver. Adventech will be building more applications!</p>

  <p>At this point Adventech ministry and me personally are praying for the guidance of the Holy Spirit, for if God is for us, who can be against us? (Romans 8:31). We do not support revolution or anything like that, but rely on God only – Romans 12:19. It is possible that more publishing houses will take path similar to Publicadora SerVir and Casa Publicadora Brasiliera – and try to stop our ministry.</p>

  <p>Because of that: we ask for your support in prayers! We ask for your support in prayers with your pastors! We ask for your support in prayers with your friends! We ask for your support in prayers with church leaders! We ask for your support in prayers for above mentioned publishing houses! We ask for your support in prayers to Jesus Christ!</p>

  <p>May God bless you all for the support.</p>
