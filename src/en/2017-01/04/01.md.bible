### The Personality of the Holy Spirit

### Read for This Week’s Study:
<a class="verse" verse="John 16:13, 14">John 16:13, 14</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Rom 8:14–16">Rom. 8:14–16</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Rom 15:13">Rom. 15:13</a>; <a class="verse" verse="John 14:6">John 14:6</a>; <a class="verse" verse="John 17:17">John 17:17</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Rom 5:5">Rom. 5:5</a>.

> <p>Memory Text</p>
> “ ‘But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="John 14:26">John 14:26</a>, NASB). 

Because the Holy Spirit is occasionally depicted in the Bible in impersonal terms, such as wind or fire, some have concluded that He is impersonal, a type of divine power. In their view, He is more like an electric current that empowers us rather than existing as a personal Being. But the question is not whether some passages can be brought forward that denote more impersonal operations or influences of the Holy Spirit. The question is whether there are numerous portions of Scripture that positively do establish His personality.

There are texts, and we need to take them into consideration in order to gain a more complete picture of who the Holy Spirit is. 

This week we will learn more about the personality of the Holy Spirit as He is described in Scripture. This truth will help us better understand the role of God’s divine Spirit in our lives. And it will help us to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of the belief in the personality of the Holy Spirit for our spiritual life. Only when we entertain right thoughts about Him can we render to Him that love, reverence, confidence, and submission that are due to Him.
