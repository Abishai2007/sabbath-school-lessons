            'Hebrews 11': '<h3> <span>Hebrews 11</span></h3><p><span><span>11&#xA0;</span>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>For by it the elders obtained a <i>good</i> testimony.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>By faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death, <span>&#x201C;and was not found, because God had taken him&#x201D;</span>;  for before he was taken he had this testimony, that he pleased God. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>But without faith <i>it is</i> impossible to please <i>Him,</i> for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and <i>that</i> He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as <i>in</i> a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise; </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>for he waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker <i>is</i> God.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>By faith Sarah herself also received strength to conceive seed, and she bore a child when she was past the age, because she judged Him faithful who had promised. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born <i>as many</i> as the stars of the sky in multitude&#x2014;innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off were assured of them, embraced <i>them</i> and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And truly if they had called to mind that <i>country</i> from which they had come out, they would have had opportunity to return. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>But now they desire a better, that is, a heavenly <i>country.</i> Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten <i>son,</i> </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>of whom it was said, <span>&#x201C;In Isaac your seed shall be called,&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>concluding that God <i>was</i> able to raise <i>him</i> up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, <i>leaning</i> on the top of his staff.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel, and gave instructions concerning his bones.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw <i>he was</i> a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king&#x2019;s command.</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>By faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter, </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the reward.</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he who destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry <i>land, whereas</i> the Egyptians, attempting to do so, were drowned.</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were encircled for seven days. </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who did not believe, when she had received the spies with peace.</span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barak and Samson and Jephthah, also <i>of</i> David and Samuel and the prophets: </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in battle, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>Women received their dead raised to life again.</span></p><p><span>Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. </span> <span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>Still others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yes, and of chains and imprisonment. </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>They were stoned, they were sawn in two, were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, <i>in</i> dens and caves of the earth.</span></p><p><span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>And all these, having obtained a good testimony through faith, did not receive the promise, </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>God having provided something better for us, that they should not be made perfect apart from us.</span></p>'
            '1 John 1:9': '<h3> <span>1 John 1:9</span></h3><p> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us <i>our</i> sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. </span> </p>'

#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: <a class="verse" verse="Ephesians 1:3–6">Ephesians 1:3–6</a>

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: God chose us before the foundation of the world. In Christ, He blessed us with every spiritual blessing so that we may reflect the grace of His character and seek His holiness. Holiness is not a state of perfection that we struggle to achieve. It is continually becoming more like Jesus, a state achieved daily through the power of the Holy Spirit as we fellowship with God in prayer and through His Word. Holiness is the result of beholding the beauty of Christ’s character.

**Just for Teachers**: God’s holiness consists largely of two major elements. First, it includes His righteous, pure character that is intrinsically part of His nature. God cannot act contrary to His own nature; so, His actions are always righteous, pure, and just. Second, God’s holiness sets Him apart from all created beings. His love, graciousness, goodness, justice, and compassion are infinite. There is no one else like Him in the entire universe (<a class="verse" verse="Lev 19:2">Lev. 19:2</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Ps 47:8">Ps. 47:8</a>; <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:15, 16">1 Pet. 1:15, 16</a>).
 
Meditating upon God’s holiness leads us to reflect His holiness in our own lives (<a class="verse" verse="2 Cor 3:18">2 Cor. 3:18</a>). Ellen G. White states clearly, “It is a law of the mind that it gradually adapts itself to the subjects upon which it is trained to dwell.”—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 596. The purpose of this week’s lesson is twofold: to help class members to understand the importance of pursuing a life of holiness and to encourage them to develop that holiness in their own lives by beholding God’s holiness in His Word.

**Opening Discussion:** When you think of God’s holiness, what comes to your mind? If you had to draw a picture of a holy God, how would you draw it? Are the images of a holy God in your mind positive or negative images? Why? What emotions does the thought of God’s holiness evoke in you? 

For some people, the thought of a holy God instills reverence and awe. For others, it instills fear and condemnation. There are those who equate God’s holiness with His hatred of sin; and because they know that they have sinned, they are overwhelmed with their own guilt in the light of God’s holiness. In this week’s lesson, we will discover that love is at the very foundation of God’s holiness and that His grace flows from His holiness. A holy God is a just God. His justice is the very basis of a universe free from the ravages of sin.

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. Why do you think it is popular to emphasize God’s love but neglect His holiness?
2. Is God’s holiness a gift or a command, or both? Why?
3. What is the difference between holiness and perfection?

#### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: There is a tension in the life of each Christian. This tension is between what we are and what we long to be. It is the tension between the real and the ideal. As committed Christians, we long to reflect the image of Jesus in all of our actions, but, at times, we fall far short of our desires. The good news is that we are accepted in Christ, redeemed by Christ, and justified by Christ. We receive salvation through His sacrifice, not by achieving some state of superholiness (<a class="verse" verse="Eph 1:6, 7; 2:8">Eph. 1:6, 7; 2:8</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Rom 5:8–10">Rom. 5:8–10</a>). In the context of His love and grace, we seek to be like Him. His love motivates us to seek His holiness (<a class="verse" verse="2 Cor 5:14, 15">2 Cor. 5:14, 15</a>). We desire to be like Him because we have been redeemed by His grace (<a class="verse" verse="1 John 3:1, 2">1 John 3:1, 2</a>). 

Concentrate on this thought throughout this week’s lesson: we seek holiness because we have been redeemed by His grace and long to imitate His character. As Scripture says, “We love Him because He first loved us” (<a class="verse" verse="1 John 4:19">1 John 4:19</a>, NKJV).

### **Bible Commentary**

1. **Living a Holy Life** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Hebrews 12:2">Hebrews 12:2</a> with the class.)

In <a class="verse" verse="Hebrews 11">Hebrews 11</a>, God outlines His Hall of Fame of the faithful. Chapter 12 begins with these words: “Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us” (<a class="verse" verse="Heb 12:1">Heb. 12:1</a>, NKJV). The metaphor of the “cloud of witnesses” conveys the idea of an athlete competing in an ancient stadium with thousands of witnesses cheering him on. The apostle Paul here states that the examples of past heroes of faith should encourage us as we race toward the kingdom. Their examples also encourage us to pursue lives of holiness. The “sin which so easily ensnares us” is simply a lack of faith that directs our eyes from Christ’s righteousness and leads us to depend on our own. It is the fatal flaw that focuses on human endeavors rather than on divine grace. It is depending on our weakness rather than on Christ’s strength.

The apostle urges each believer to look to Jesus, the “author and finisher of our faith” (<a class="verse" verse="Heb 12:2">Heb. 12:2</a>). The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary puts it this way: “To keep the eye of faith fixed upon Jesus is to maintain uninterrupted contact with Him who is the source of power, Him who can strengthen us to endure and to overcome.”—Volume 7, p. 481. The word for “finisher” in <a class="verse" verse="Hebrews 12:2">Hebrews 12:2</a> is the Greek word telei-ot-es, which means the one who completes, perfects, or finishes. 

Jesus is both our Savior and Lord. He is the One who died for us and the One who lives for us. He is the One who justifies and sanctifies us. He is the One who began a good work in us and will finish it. Through the ministry of the Holy Spirit, the Third Person of the Godhead, we “grow in grace, and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 3:18">2 Pet. 3:18</a>). Through Christ, we who are unholy are accepted as holy and through His grace made holy.

**Consider This**: In <a class="verse" verse="Romans 7:12">Romans 7:12</a>, the apostle Paul describes the law of God as “holy, righteous and good” (NIV). Throughout the Bible, God also is described as holy (<a class="verse" verse="Isa 6:3">Isa. 6:3</a>), just (<a class="verse" verse="1 John 1:9">1 John 1:9</a>), and good (<a class="verse" verse="Ps 25:8">Ps. 25:8</a>). If these are the characteristics of both God and the law, what does this equivalence tell you about the very nature of the law? What relationship does living a Spirit-filled life have with the law of God? Discuss this statement with your class: “You can attempt to keep the law without love, but you cannot truly love without keeping the law.”

#### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: In our feel-good, often self-centered society, the concepts of self-denial, obedience, and holiness may seem unintelligible to most people. Help your class understand that the very essence of the Christian life is that believers, saved by grace and transformed by God’s love, naturally seek holiness. When you admire someone, you strive to be like the one you most admire. Christ’s love wins our hearts, and we long to be like Him in character.

**Application Questions:**

1. How can we develop new habits and practices to guide us on our journey to holiness?
2. What are the things in our lives that distract us from living holy lives?
3. Why does living a life of holiness seem so challenging at times?

#### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: Pursuing holiness is really pursuing God and desiring to be like Him in character. Help your class understand that the Holy Spirit will produce holiness in the lives of all who spend time seeking God through prayer and His Word.

**Activities:**
1. Ask your class to share what new concepts of holiness they discovered in this week’s lesson.
2. Pass out a blank four-by-six-inch index card to each class member. Ask each student to write a prayer for holiness on his or her card in just three or four sentences. (Where supplies are unavailable, ask class members to quietly compose their prayers in their hearts.) Here is one example of a prayer for holiness.

Dear Lord,

Today, I long to be more like You. At times, I feel too rushed to spend time in Your presence. Please forgive me for my busyness. Slow me down long enough to hear Your voice. Change me by Your Holy Spirit, and may I live the life of holiness that You have called me to.

In Jesus’ name, amen.
