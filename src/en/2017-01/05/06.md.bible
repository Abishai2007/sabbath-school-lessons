            'Ephesians 5:1–9, 17–20': '<h3> <span>Ephesians 5:1-9</span></h3><p><span><span>5&#xA0;</span>Therefore be imitators of God as dear children. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints; </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore do not be partakers with them.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>For you were once darkness, but now <i>you are</i> light in the Lord. Walk as children of light </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>(for the fruit of the Spirit <i>is</i> in all goodness, righteousness, and truth), </span> </p><h3> <span>Ephesians 5:17-20</span></h3><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord <i>is.</i> </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit, </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>giving thanks always for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, </span> </p>'
            'Galatians 5:16–26': '<h3> <span>Galatians 5:16-26</span></h3><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told <i>you</i> in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And those <i>who are</i> Christ&#x2019;s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</span></p>'
            '2 Cor 5:14': '<h3> <span>2 Corinthians 5:14</span></h3><p> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; </span> </p>'
            'Phil 1:6': '<h3> <span>Philippians 1:6</span></h3><p> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete <i>it</i> until the day of Jesus Christ; </span> </p>'
            'Gal 3:3': '<h3> <span>Galatians 3:3</span></h3><p> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh? </span> </p>'

### Self-Centered Living Versus Christ-Centered Living 

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 5:16–26">Galatians 5:16–26</a> and compare it with <a class="verse" verse="Ephesians 5:1–9, 17–20">Ephesians 5:1–9, 17–20</a>. List the differences between a self-centered life and a life that is filled with the Spirit.`

The life of a person who does not live in the Spirit is radically different from the life and values of a person who is filled with the Spirit.

| Self-Centered Person | Spirit-Controlled Person |
|:-:|:-:|
| Desires what is sinful and displeasing to God | Desires what is spiritual and pleasing to God |
| Is controlled by sinful passions | Is controlled by the Spirit |
| Misuses his/her freedom and gets enslaved in sin | Is set free from the bondage of sin and is called to freedom in Christ |
| Is disobedient to God’s will | Is obedient to God’s will |
| Is self-indulgent | Is self-sacrificing |
| Displays the fruit of sin | Displays the fruit of the Spirit |
| Does not recognize the need for forgiveness and is boastful of self | Recognizes the need for forgiveness and praises Jesus for what He has done |
 
The life of a person who is filled with God’s Spirit is characterized by a loving obedience to God’s law and a gentle spirit of compassion for others (see <a class="verse" verse="2 Cor 5:14">2 Cor. 5:14</a>, NASB). Having been renewed in our minds and thinking and having received new hearts and a new outlook on life, our values and behavior will change. We want to live no longer in our own strength but in submission to the Holy Spirit (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 3:3">Gal. 3:3</a>). 

We cannot transform ourselves. We possess no real power to change ourselves, for sin is too deeply ingrained in us. The renewing energy must come from God. The change from within can be successful only through the transforming work of the Holy Spirit. No mere external change, such as correcting this or that bad habit, makes us Christians. The change has to come from a heart renewed by the Holy Spirit. 

This is the work of a lifetime, a work that will have its up and downs, but a work that God promises to do in us if we surrender to Him, “being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ” (<a class="verse" verse="Phil 1:6">Phil. 1:6</a>, NKJV).

`In what areas of your life do you see the selfish, self-centered part come through, and in what parts do you see a life that reflects the working of the Holy Spirit in you? What does your answer tell you about yourself and the choices you need to make?`
