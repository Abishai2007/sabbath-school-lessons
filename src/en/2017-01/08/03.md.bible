            '1 Corinthians 12:14–31': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 12:14-31</span></h3><p> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For in fact the body is not one member but many.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>If the foot should say, &#x201C;Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body,&#x201D; is it therefore not of the body? </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And if the ear should say, &#x201C;Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body,&#x201D; is it therefore not of the body? </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>If the whole body <i>were</i> an eye, where <i>would be</i> the hearing? If the whole <i>were</i> hearing, where <i>would be</i> the smelling? </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He pleased. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And if they were all one member, where <i>would</i> the body <i>be?</i></span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>But now indeed <i>there are</i> many members, yet one body. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And the eye cannot say to the hand, &#x201C;I have no need of you&#x201D;; nor again the head to the feet, &#x201C;I have no need of you.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And those <i>members</i> of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable <i>parts</i> have greater modesty, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>but our presentable <i>parts</i> have no need. But God composed the body, having given greater honor to that <i>part</i> which lacks it, </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>that there should be no schism in the body, but <i>that</i> the members should have the same care for one another. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with <i>it;</i> or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with <i>it.</i></span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup><i>Are</i> all apostles? <i>Are</i> all prophets? <i>Are</i> all teachers? <i>Are</i> all workers of miracles? </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>But earnestly desire the best gifts. And yet I show you a more excellent way.</span></p>'
            'Ephesians 4:7': '<h3> <span>Ephesians 4:7</span></h3><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ&#x2019;s gift. </span> </p>'

### God, the Sovereign Giver of the Spiritual Gifts

It is not we who decide what gifts to have. The Greek word for the gifts of the Spirit is charismata—they are gifts of grace, distributed and given by God Himself. We do not earn them by our status, our position, our honor, our education, or our spiritual performance. They are gifts, freely given out of love so that we can fulfill the task God has assigned us to do.

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Ephesians 4:7">Ephesians 4:7</a>. We often think that the Holy Spirit is the One who bestows spiritual gifts. The apostle Paul also connects Jesus Christ with the giving of the gifts. How is Jesus involved in the giving of the gifts?` 

Paul says that the grace of Christ secured the right to give us gifts. But it is the Holy Spirit who distributes them to the members of the church. Those who have accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Savior and believe in Him will be equipped by the Holy Spirit with spiritual gifts “as He wills” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 12:11">1 Cor. 12:11</a>, NASB). The bestowal of the gifts is God’s sovereign decision. 

Innate ability as such is not a spiritual gift. Spiritual gifts are not the same as natural talents that a person might develop through intense education. Many non-Christians are blessed with such providential talents. While every good thing and perfect gift is ultimately from God (<a class="verse" verse="James 1:17">James 1:17</a>), God has decided to equip His believers with special gifts in order to bless the lives of other Christians and to build up His church. God also can use a natural talent for that purpose when the person acknowledges that even such a talent ultimately comes from God and then prayerfully and submissively dedicates that talent to the Lord’s work.

`What does Paul tell his readers in <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 12:14–31">1 Corinthians 12:14–31</a> about the distribution of the gifts? Why is this perspective so important for understanding how spiritual gifts function in the church?`

The Holy Spirit is the one who distributes the gifts according to His wisdom and will. Since He loves us and knows best how we can serve Him most efficiently, we do not need to be envious of others and their gifts. To envy other gifts is a sign of ingratitude toward God and of doubting His wisdom in the distribution of His gifts.

`What gifts has God granted to members of your church? What message can you take away from the fact that different people have different gifts?`
