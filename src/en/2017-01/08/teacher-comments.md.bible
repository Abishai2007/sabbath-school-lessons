            '1 Cor 1; 1 Cor 8; 1 Cor 11; 1 Cor 14': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 1</span></h3><p><span><span>1&#xA0;</span>Paul, called <i>to be</i> an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes <i>our</i> brother,</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called <i>to be</i> saints, with all who in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given to you by Christ Jesus, </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>that you were enriched in everything by Him in all utterance and all knowledge, </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you, </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>so that you come short in no gift, eagerly waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>who will also confirm you to the end, <i>that you may be</i> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>God <i>is</i> faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Now I plead with you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and <i>that</i> there be no divisions among you, but <i>that</i> you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of Chloe&#x2019;s <i>household,</i> that there are contentions among you. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Now I say this, that each of you says, &#x201C;I am of Paul,&#x201D; or &#x201C;I am of Apollos,&#x201D; or &#x201C;I am of Cephas,&#x201D; or &#x201C;I am of Christ.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>lest anyone should say that I had baptized in my own name. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides, I do not know whether I baptized any other. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For it is written:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x201C;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,</span></span><br><span><span>And bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Where <i>is</i> the wise? Where <i>is</i> the scribe? Where <i>is</i> the disputer of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>For Jews request a sign, and Greeks seek after wisdom; </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>For you see your calling, brethren, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, <i>are called.</i> </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty; </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>that no flesh should glory in His presence. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God&#x2014;and righteousness and sanctification and redemption&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>that, as it is written, <span>&#x201C;He who glories, let him glory in the L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span>.&#x201D;</span></span></p><h3> <span>1 Corinthians 8</span></h3><p><span><span>8&#xA0;</span>Now concerning things offered to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Therefore concerning the eating of things offered to idols, we know that an idol <i>is</i> nothing in the world, and that <i>there is</i> no other God but one. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords), </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>yet for us <i>there is</i> one God, the Father, of whom <i>are</i> all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom <i>are</i> all things, and through whom we <i>live.</i></span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>However, <i>there is</i> not in everyone that knowledge; for some, with consciousness of the idol, until now eat <i>it</i> as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But food does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol&#x2019;s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things offered to idols? </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And because of your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>But when you thus sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.</span></p><h3> <span>1 Corinthians 11</span></h3><p><span><span>11&#xA0;</span>Imitate me, just as I also <i>imitate</i> Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions just as I delivered <i>them</i> to you. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, the head of woman <i>is</i> man, and the head of Christ <i>is</i> God. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Every man praying or prophesying, having <i>his</i> head covered, dishonors his head. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>But every woman who prays or prophesies with <i>her</i> head uncovered dishonors her head, for that is one and the same as if her head were shaved. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>For a man indeed ought not to cover <i>his</i> head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>For man is not from woman, but woman from man. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Nor was man created for the woman, but woman for the man. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For this reason the woman ought to have <i>a symbol of</i> authority on <i>her</i> head, because of the angels. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless, neither <i>is</i> man independent of woman, nor woman independent of man, in the Lord. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>For as woman <i>came</i> from man, even so man also <i>comes</i> through woman; but all things are from God.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Judge among yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him? </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her; for <i>her</i> hair is given to her for a covering. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor <i>do</i> the churches of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Now in giving these instructions I do not praise <i>you,</i> since you come together not for the better but for the worse. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For first of all, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For there must also be factions among you, that those who are approved may be recognized among you. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lord&#x2019;s Supper. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>For in eating, each one takes his own supper ahead of <i>others;</i> and one is hungry and another is drunk. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise <i>you.</i></span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the <i>same</i> night in which He was betrayed took bread; </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>and when He had given thanks, He broke <i>it</i> and said, <span>&#x201C;Take, eat;</span><span> this is My body which is broken</span><span> for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>In the same manner <i>He</i> also <i>took</i> the cup after supper, saying, <span>&#x201C;This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink <i>it,</i> in remembrance of Me.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord&#x2019;s death till He comes.</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks <i>this</i> cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord&#x2019;s body. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>For this reason many <i>are</i> weak and sick among you, and many sleep. </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come.</span></p><h3> <span>1 Corinthians 14</span></h3><p><span><span>14&#xA0;</span>Pursue love, and desire spiritual <i>gifts,</i> but especially that you may prophesy. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God, for no one understands <i>him;</i> however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>But he who prophesies speaks edification and exhortation and comfort to men. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>I wish you all spoke with tongues, but even more that you prophesied; for he who prophesies <i>is</i> greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless indeed he interprets, that the church may receive edification.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation, by knowledge, by prophesying, or by teaching? </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Even things without life, whether flute or harp, when they make a sound, unless they make a distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is piped or played? </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>For if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound, who will prepare for battle? </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>So likewise you, unless you utter by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them <i>is</i> without significance. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be a foreigner to him who speaks, and he who speaks <i>will be</i> a foreigner to me. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Even so you, since you are zealous for spiritual <i>gifts, let it be</i> for the edification of the church <i>that</i> you seek to excel.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>What is <i>the conclusion</i> then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the understanding. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the understanding. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you say? </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not edified.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all; </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, do not be children in understanding; however, in malice be babes, but in understanding be mature.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>In the law it is written:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x201C;With</span> <i>men of</i> <span>other tongues and other lips</span></span><br><span><span>I will speak to this people;</span></span><br><span><span>And yet, for all that, they will not hear Me,&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span>says the Lord.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Therefore if the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in <i>those who are</i> uninformed or unbelievers, will they not say that you are out of your mind? </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an uninformed person comes in, he is convinced by all, he is convicted by all. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed; and so, falling down on <i>his</i> face, he will worship God and report that God is truly among you.</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>How is it then, brethren? Whenever you come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification. </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>If anyone speaks in a tongue, <i>let there be</i> two or at the most three, <i>each</i> in turn, and let one interpret. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>But if <i>anything</i> is revealed to another who sits by, let the first keep silent. </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>For God is not <i>the author</i> of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Let your women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but <i>they are</i> to be submissive, as the law also says. </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>And if they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in church.</span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>Or did the word of God come <i>originally</i> from you? Or <i>was it</i> you only that it reached? </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord. </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</span></p><p><span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues. </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>Let all things be done decently and in order.</span></p>'
            '1 Corinthians 12:27, 28': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 12:27</span></h3><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually. </span> </p><h3> <span>1 Corinthians 12:28</span></h3><p> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues. </span> </p>'

            '1 Cor 1; 1 Cor 8; 1 Cor 11; 1 Cor 14': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 1</span></h3><p><span><span>1&#xA0;</span>Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their&apos;s and our&apos;s:</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>That no flesh should glory in his presence.</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</span></p><h3> <span>1 Corinthians 8</span></h3><p><span><span>8&#xA0;</span>Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>But if any man love God, the same is known of him.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol&apos;s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.</span></p><h3> <span>1 Corinthians 11</span></h3><p><span><span>11&#xA0;</span>Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord&apos;s supper.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? what shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord&apos;s death till he come.</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord&apos;s body.</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</span></p><h3> <span>1 Corinthians 14</span></h3><p><span><span>14&#xA0;</span>Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.</span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.</span></p><p><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.</span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?</span></p><p><span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.</span></p><p><span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</span></p><p><span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.</span></p><p><span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>Let all things be done decently and in order.</span></p>'

#### **Learning Cycle**

#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 12:4–11">1 Corinthians 12:4–11</a>

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: The Holy Spirit imparts gifts to each believer to build up Christ’s church and to accomplish Christ’s mission in the community. Our Lord has not given us a task without equipping us for that task. He has not given us a mission without giving us the necessary gifts to fulfill the mission. The gifts of the Spirit are given to each believer in order that he or she may fulfill a role as a member of the body of Christ in glorifying God through ministry in the body.

**Just for Teachers**: This week’s lesson reveals one of the most powerful principles in the entire Bible for growing healthy churches. God has given every member gifts for ministry in the church and in the community. He or she may not realize what those gifts are, but the Holy Spirit has imparted them. When we recognize the gifts that God has given us and use them to His glory, the church functions as a healthy body. 

Encourage your class members to pray that God will help them recognize their gifts, and guide them in using these gifts to advance His kingdom. Share the thought that the same Holy Spirit that imparts the gifts will reveal to each one of us which gifts He has imparted and how to best use them in Christ’s service. When we are sensitive to the working of the Holy Spirit and are completely committed to Christ and His work, the Spirit will guide us in discerning our gifts, and teach us how to best use them to glorify God.

**Opening Discussion:** Let’s read together the gifts of the Holy Spirit listed in <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 12:27, 28">1 Corinthians 12:27, 28</a> and <a class="verse" verse="Romans 12:6–8">Romans 12:6–8</a>. If you could choose to have any one of these gifts, which one would you choose? Why would you choose that particular gift? What makes that gift desirable to you? 

Can you remember a special birthday or Christmas as a child when you wanted something badly but were disappointed when you did not get it? This disappointment happened to a little girl who prayed for an elephant. She longed for a baby elephant as a pet. There was nothing she wanted more than a real elephant. Do you think her parents bought her a baby elephant to keep in the backyard? Certainly not! They were much wiser than this little girl. There are times when we pray for our “elephants,” but God is much wiser than we are and imparts the gifts to us that He best knows we will use to glorify His name in service for Him.

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. Why do you think the Holy Spirit chooses the gifts for each believer and does not encourage us to pray for a specific gift?
2. What gifts are we encouraged to seek? (See <a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 12:30, 31">1 Cor. 12:30, 31</a>.)
3. What is the difference between a spiritual gift and a natural talent?
4. Why is the topic of spiritual gifts so encouraging?

#### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: Each of God’s gifts is given to us out of the abundance of His grace and love. It is because He loves His church so deeply that He imparts to us gifts to build up His church. Although each Christian cannot do everything, each one of us can do something for Christ. Each one has been given gifts for service. 

Although these gifts vary, they all are necessary for a healthy, functioning church. There are no superior and inferior gifts. The gift of helps is just as important to the church as the gift of healing. The gift of hospitality is just as important as the gift of proclamation. The gift of generosity is just as important as the gift of administration. Can you imagine a church without those who had the gift of helps, the gift of hospitality, or the gift of generosity? It certainly would be a cold, self-centered, inward-focused group of people. Every gift is essential. As the apostle Paul so aptly puts it, “But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He pleased. . . . Those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 12:18, 22">1 Cor. 12:18, 22</a>, NKJV). Help your class to understand that each member is necessary, each one has been given gifts by God, and each one is called by God to use those gifts, whether they are large or small, for the advancement of His kingdom.

### **Bible Commentary**

1. **I. The Holy Spirit Imparts Spiritual Gifts for Service** (Review <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 12:11">1 Corinthians 12:11</a> with the class.)

The Corinthian church was fraught with serious spiritual problems. There was jealousy, envy, and strife among the members (<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 3:3, 4">1 Cor. 3:3, 4</a>). Immorality crept into the church (<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 5:1">1 Cor. 5:1</a>). Some members even threatened to take others to the civil courts to solve their problems (<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 6:1">1 Cor. 6:1</a>). There were arguments over eating meat that had been offered to idols, an abuse of the Lord’s Supper, and a misuse of spiritual gifts (<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 1; 1 Cor 8; 1 Cor 11; 1 Cor 14">1 Cor 1; 1 Cor 8; 1 Cor 11; 1 Cor 14</a>; ). The church at Corinth was divided, filled with conflict, and threatened with a schism.

It is in this context that the apostle Paul, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, writes to them about spiritual gifts as a unifying force. He outlines three key points about spiritual gifts in the life and ministry of the church: 

1. A sovereign God gives the gifts as He chooses. We do not choose which gifts we receive. He chooses which gifts He gives. 
2. Every believer receives at least one specific gift imparted by the Holy Spirit. 
3. The function of all of the gifts is to glorify God by building up the church, unifying the body of Christ, and reaching out in mission to the community.

It is the same Holy Spirit who imparts each gift to believers. Paul makes this point too plain to be misunderstood. “But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 12:11">1 Cor. 12:11</a>, NKJV). Ellen G. White adds, “To every person is committed some peculiar gift or talent which is to be used to advance the Redeemer’s kingdom.”—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 618. Each one of us has been given a particular gift by Christ to be used in His service. No one is left out. Every gift is necessary in order to build God’s kingdom and advance His cause.

**Consider This**: What is the function of spiritual gifts? How do the gifts serve as a unifying force in the church?

#### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Just for Teachers: Guide your class in a practical discussion on how to discover their gifts and how to use them in Christ’s service. Point out that the same Holy Spirit who has imparted gifts will reveal those gifts. Here are a few steps to help your class discover the gifts God has given:

1. Commit your life to Christ, and thank Him for the gifts of the Spirit He has given you.
2. Ask Him to reveal those gifts.
3. Analyze the areas of witness and service you feel God is calling you to and then get involved in service.
4. Remember that our gifts do not come developed fully. The more we use the gifts that God has given, the more they will grow, and the more efficient we will become in using them.
5. Look for some affirmation from other members of the body of Christ that God has gifted you in particular areas.

**Thought Questions**:

1. When we commit our lives to Jesus and are baptized, He promises to send His Spirit to strengthen us in order that we may face the temptations of Satan and to impart spiritual gifts for service. Why is it that, at times, we fail to recognize our gifts?
2. How can we know which gifts God has given us?

**Application Questions**:

1. How can we help one another to discover our spiritual gifts?
2. What gifts do other class members have? Consider your Sabbath School class. Invite members to name some of the gifts they see in other members of the class.

#### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: As we discover the gifts that God has given us, and use them to build up His church and to witness in the community, we will find joy in service. Spiritual satisfaction occurs when we use the gifts we have been given in order to bless others. We take no glory for these gifts, because we know that they are gifts given by a loving Lord to advance His cause.

**Activities**:

1. What gifts has God given you, and how can you more effectively use those gifts in service.
2. Think of some creative project for your Sabbath School class that uniquely uses the gifts of each member. How can you collectively use your gifts for the cause of Christ?
