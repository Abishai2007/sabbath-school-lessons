        verses:
            '1 Corinthians 12:4–7, 11': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 12:4-7</span></h3><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit <i>of all:</i> </span> </p><h3> <span>1 Corinthians 12:11</span></h3><p> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.</span></p>'
            'Ephesians 4:11–13': '<h3> <span>Ephesians 4:11-13</span></h3><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And He Himself gave some <i>to be</i> apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; </span> </p>'
            '1 Corinthians 12': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 12</span></h3><p><span><span>12&#xA0;</span>Now concerning spiritual <i>gifts,</i> brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant: </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, however you were led. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit <i>of all:</i> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another <i>different</i> kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also <i>is</i> Christ. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body&#x2014;whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free&#x2014;and have all been made to drink into one Spirit. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For in fact the body is not one member but many.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>If the foot should say, &#x201C;Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body,&#x201D; is it therefore not of the body? </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And if the ear should say, &#x201C;Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body,&#x201D; is it therefore not of the body? </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>If the whole body <i>were</i> an eye, where <i>would be</i> the hearing? If the whole <i>were</i> hearing, where <i>would be</i> the smelling? </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He pleased. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And if they were all one member, where <i>would</i> the body <i>be?</i></span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>But now indeed <i>there are</i> many members, yet one body. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And the eye cannot say to the hand, &#x201C;I have no need of you&#x201D;; nor again the head to the feet, &#x201C;I have no need of you.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And those <i>members</i> of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable <i>parts</i> have greater modesty, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>but our presentable <i>parts</i> have no need. But God composed the body, having given greater honor to that <i>part</i> which lacks it, </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>that there should be no schism in the body, but <i>that</i> the members should have the same care for one another. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with <i>it;</i> or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with <i>it.</i></span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup><i>Are</i> all apostles? <i>Are</i> all prophets? <i>Are</i> all teachers? <i>Are</i> all workers of miracles? </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>But earnestly desire the best gifts. And yet I show you a more excellent way.</span></p>'
            'Romans 12:3–8': '<h3> <span>Romans 12:3-8</span></h3><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think <i>of himself</i> more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function, </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>so we, <i>being</i> many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, <i>let us use them:</i> if prophecy, <i>let us prophesy</i> in proportion to our faith; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>or ministry, <i>let us use it</i> in <i>our</i> ministering; he who teaches, in teaching; </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.</span></p>'
            'Rom 12:9, 10': '<h3> <span>Romans 12:9</span></h3><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup><i>Let</i> love <i>be</i> without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil. Cling to what is good. </span> </p><h3> <span>Romans 12:10</span></h3><p> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup><i>Be</i> kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor giving preference to one another; </span> </p>'
            '1 Cor 13:13': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 13:13</span></h3><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these <i>is</i> love.</span></p>'

### The Fruit of the Spirit and the Gifts of the Spirit

The fruit of the Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit have the same Author. Yet, they are not the same. No one is required to manifest a gift of the Spirit, but everyone should manifest the fruit of the Spirit. Spiritual gifts do not necessarily testify to spirituality, but the fruit of the Spirit does. While there is only one fruit, there are many gifts, and some are greater than others. 

`Read <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 12:4–7, 11">1 Corinthians 12:4–7, 11</a>. What is the essence of what Paul is teaching here?` 

While all aspects of the fruit of the Spirit are designed by God to be visible in the life of His followers, not every believer has the same gift or gifts. There is no command that all should have one particular gift, such as speaking in tongues. Instead, God sovereignly equips His believers with different gifts as He sees fit. The gifts of the Spirit are given so that we can serve others and build up the body of Christ, His church. These gifts are not given for our own pleasure and glory. They are bestowed to further the cause of God. 

Therefore, spiritual gifts are worthless without the fruit of the Spirit. It is interesting that within the context of the spiritual gifts, love is often alluded to. Immediately after <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 12">1 Corinthians 12</a> comes the supreme description of love, in chapter 13. <a class="verse" verse="Ephesians 4:11–13">Ephesians 4:11–13</a> is followed in verses 15 and 16 with references to love. The next verses after <a class="verse" verse="Romans 12:3–8">Romans 12:3–8</a>, where the gifts of the Spirit are mentioned, speak about love (see <a class="verse" verse="Rom 12:9, 10">Rom. 12:9, 10</a>). 

The gifts are, after all, gifts of grace; that is, they are gifts of love. They are given out of love and serve the love of God in reaching other people. By loving others, we are revealing the love of God to them. A loving and omniscient God provides the means to accomplish what He has commissioned His people to do. Perhaps that is why love is the greatest gift of all (<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 13:13">1 Cor. 13:13</a>).

`Why is love so central to all that we do as Christians? How does love, in a sense, “empower” our witness?`
