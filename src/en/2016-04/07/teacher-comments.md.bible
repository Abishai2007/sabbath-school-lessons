That one whom He chooses He will cause to come near to Him. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Do this: Take censers, Korah and all your company; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>put fire in them and put incense in them before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> tomorrow, and it shall be <i>that</i> the man whom the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> chooses <i>is</i> the holy one. <i>You take</i> too much upon yourselves, you sons of Levi!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then Moses said to Korah, &#x201C;Hear now, you sons of Levi: </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup><i>Is it</i> a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the work of the tabernacle of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, and to stand before the congregation to serve them; </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>and that He has brought you near <i>to Himself,</i> you and all your brethren, the sons of Levi, with you? And are you seeking the priesthood also? </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Therefore you and all your company <i>are</i> gathered together against the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>. And what <i>is</i> Aaron that you complain against him?&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, but they said, &#x201C;We will not come up! </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup><i>Is it</i> a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you should keep acting like a prince over us? </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Moreover you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Then Moses was very angry, and said to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, &#x201C;Do not respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, nor have I hurt one of them.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And Moses said to Korah, &#x201C;Tomorrow, you and all your company be present before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>&#x2014;you and they, as well as Aaron. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Let each take his censer and put incense in it, and each of you bring his censer before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, two hundred and fifty censers; both you and Aaron, each <i>with</i> his censer.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>So every man took his censer, put fire in it, laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the tabernacle of meeting with Moses and Aaron. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And Korah gathered all the congregation against them at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. Then the glory of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> appeared to all the congregation.</span></p> <p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Then they fell on their faces, and said, &#x201C;O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and You be angry with all the congregation?&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>So the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Speak to the congregation, saying, &#x2018;Get away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And he spoke to the congregation, saying, &#x201C;Depart now from the tents of these wicked men! Touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>So they got away from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little children.</span></p> <p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And Moses said: &#x201C;By this you shall know that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> has sent me to do all these works, for <i>I have</i> not <i>done them</i> of my own will. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>If these men die naturally like all men, or if they are visited by the common fate of all men, <i>then</i> the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> has not sent me. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>But if the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> creates a new thing, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the pit, then you will understand that these men have rejected the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Now it came to pass, as he finished speaking all these words, that the ground split apart under them, </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and all the men with Korah, with all <i>their</i> goods. </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>So they and all those with them went down alive into the pit; the earth closed over them, and they perished from among the assembly. </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Then all Israel who <i>were</i> around them fled at their cry, for they said, &#x201C;Lest the earth swallow us up <i>also!</i>&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>And a fire came out from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering incense.</span></p> <p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying: </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Tell Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to pick up the censers out of the blaze, for they are holy, and scatter the fire some distance away. </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>The censers of these men who sinned against their own souls, let them be made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar. Because they presented them before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned up had presented, and they were hammered out as a covering on the altar, </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup><i>to be</i> a memorial to the children of Israel that no outsider, who <i>is</i> not a descendant of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, that he might not become like Korah and his companions, just as the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> had said to him through Moses.</span></p> <h3><span>Complaints of the People</span></h3><p><span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>On the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, saying, &#x201C;You have killed the people of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>Now it happened, when the congregation had gathered against Moses and Aaron, that they turned toward the tabernacle of meeting; and suddenly the cloud covered it, and the glory of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> appeared. </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>Then Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of meeting.</span></p> <p><span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, </span> <span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>And they fell on their faces.</span></p> <p><span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>So Moses said to Aaron, &#x201C;Take a censer and put fire in it from the altar, put incense <i>on it,</i> and take it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>. The plague has begun.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>Then Aaron took <i>it</i> as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and already the plague had begun among the people. So he put in the incense and made atonement for the people. </span> <span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>And he stood between the dead and the living; so the plague was stopped. </span> <span><sup>49&#xA0;</sup>Now those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died in the Korah incident. </span> <span><sup>50&#xA0;</sup>So Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tabernacle of meeting, for the plague had stopped.</span></p></div>"

for I have not done them of mine own mind.</span></p> <p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> hath not sent me.</span></p> <p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>But if the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:</span></p> <p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.</span></p> <p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.</span></p> <p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.</span></p> <p><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>And there came out a fire from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.</span></p> <p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> spake unto Moses, saying,</span></p> <p><span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.</span></p> <p><span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.</span></p> <p><span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered;

### _The Lesson in Brief_

**Key Texts**: <a class="verse" verse="Job 11:7, 8">Job 11:7, 8</a>; <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 3:5–7">2 Peter 3:5–7</a>

#### **The Student Will:**
- **Know:** Contrast historical examples of God’s retributive judgment with Job’s specific situation.
- **Feel:** Appreciate God’s sovereignty as He deals with humankind throughout history in love and righteousness.
- **Do:** Seek for a healthy and biblical balance in the understanding of God’s justice and mercy in his or her own life and others’ lives.

#### **Learning Outline:**
1. Know: Retributive Judgment
   + **A** How do you understand what happened during the Flood or in Sodom and Gomorrah in terms of God’s retributive judgment?
   + **B** What is the big difference between these events and the way in which Job’s friends reacted to Job?
2. Feel: The Deep Things of God
   + **A** What are our limitations in understanding the way that God deals with humanity throughout history?
   + **B** What can we be certain of, though, in God’s dealings with us, even if we don’t understand His ways?
3. Do: Finding a Balance
   + **A** Does God still use direct retributive judgment during our times? Explain.
   + **B** How is it possible to find a balance in our view of God’s grace and mercy?
 
**Summary:** Bildad and Zophar really drive their point home in a tone that becomes increasingly harsh as Job affirms his own innocence. While there is direct retributive divine judgment in the Bible, God’s ways are not ours, and it is not for us to to determine when God punishes directly or not. Our task is to lessen suffering whatever the cause is.

#### **Learning Cycle**
------

#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 3:5–7">2 Peter 3:5–7</a>

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: There will be a final day of judgment in which God will destroy everything evil and its originator. It is important to recognize God as the One who actively is involved in this process and who has given ample historical evidence throughout the Bible to assure us of the final outcome of the great controversy. However, not all suffering is an example of God’s retributive punishment, and this assumption is where Job’s friends went terribly wrong.

**Just for Teachers**: The unity of our church is often challenged by viewpoints that represent extremes. But those who present these extremes argue that anything less than following their point of view would amount to compromising the truth. It appears very difficult for us to find a balanced approach, a middle ground that upholds unity.

**Opening Discussion**: We all know the sad story of the massacre of the children in Bethlehem that followed the birth of Jesus (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 2:13–18">Matt. 2:13–18</a>). To recap: only the children who were three years and older survived; all younger infants were cruelly killed by Herod’s henchmen. It’s a horrifying story of fulfilled Messianic prophecy (Matthew is quoting from Jeremiah), of divine protection (Joseph and his family flee to Egypt, prompted by a divine dream), and of Satan’s attempt to kill the young Messiah.

However, John Chrysostom (ca. a.d. 349–407), an early church father and the archbishop of Constantinople, suggested that Herod’s massacre provides an excellent proof text for the doctrine of the Trinity: only the three-year-old children survive, thus signifying those who believe in the doctrine of the Trinity (the three-year-old children symbolize a threefold God), while the two-year-old children die (representing the binitarian view—only two Persons in the divinity), as well as the one-year-old children (representing the unitarian view—God is only one Person).

To understand the significance of this interpretation, we need to place it in its proper historical context: Chrysostom lived in a century marked by the great Arian debate on the Trinity (Arius suggested, in the third century a.d., that Christ was subordinate to, and created by, God), which almost tore the early church apart. We would call Chrysostom’s view an allegorical interpretation.

While we, as Chrysostom did, believe in the Trinity, we might not necessarily look for it in the story of Herod’s massacre. What did Chrysostom, as well as Job’s friends, miss?

#### STEP 2—Explore
**Just for Teachers**: One of the most important principles of biblical interpretation is the question of context. Both Bildad and Zophar make the big mistake of not looking at the context of Job’s suffering. They drew on a limited understanding of God that does not take into consideration a changing context. While God’s judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah is an example of direct retributive divine punishment, Job’s situation requires a closer look at a completely different context. Here is a thoroughly and consistently righteous man who is suffering. But how could his friends have known better? Their avoidance in looking at the big picture makes them oblivious to the real issue and susceptible to sinning with their words, leading eventually to the necessity of Job’s interceding on their behalf at the end of the book.

### **Bible Commentary**

There are a number of true and important statements sprinkled throughout both Bildad’s and Zophar’s otherwise harsh and hurtful speeches that are worth looking at. While they fail to portray God correctly and bring no relief to their friend’s suffering, they nevertheless have a partial understanding of God. However, a partial understanding can sometimes be more harmful than none at all, especially when it comes to the Bible.

1. **Harsh Words** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Job 8:1–20">Job 8:1–20</a> and 11:1–20 with the class.)

Bildad’s speech, as recorded in <a class="verse" verse="Job 8:1–20">Job 8:1–20</a>, responds to Job’s passionate plea in defense of his innocence, in chapters 6 and 7. He delivers his response in a calm and analytical way. Nevertheless, it contains almost scathing words, dismissing Job’s words as “blustering wind” (<a class="verse" verse="Job 8:2">Job 8:2</a>, NIV). For Bildad, there is no doubt that God (a) always punishes the wicked (<a class="verse" verse="Job 8:13">Job 8:13</a>) and (b) always prospers the righteous (<a class="verse" verse="Job 8:20">Job 8:20</a>). In order to support his argument he draws on logic (<a class="verse" verse="Job 8:3–7">Job 8:3–7</a>) and tradition (<a class="verse" verse="Job 8:8–10">Job 8:8–10</a>) and analogies from nature (<a class="verse" verse="Job 9:5–9">Job 9:5–9</a>). As a side note: his imagery of the papyrus plant that wilts without moisture is interesting (<a class="verse" verse="Job 8:11, 12">Job 8:11, 12</a>), given that Moses, who wrote the book of Job, was very familiar with this plant, which grew profusely in the Nile delta in Egypt from whence he fled. Bildad’s logic and acid analysis desensitized him to the suffering of Job, reducing God to a mechanical executioner of His own justice.

Zophar, on the other hand, after listening to another two chapters of Job’s desperate plea in defense of his innocence (<a class="verse" verse="Job 9, 10">Job 9, 10</a>), brings retribution theology to its cruel conclusion and even beyond that: Job must have sinned, as is evident from his suffering (<a class="verse" verse="Job 11:1–4">Job 11:1–4</a>). As a consequence, Job should be punished even more because he is not admitting his guilt (<a class="verse" verse="Job 11:5, 6">Job 11:5, 6</a>).

However, in the midst of all this theological gibberish, there is a true statement about the “deep things of God” (<a class="verse" verse="Job 11:7, 8">Job 11:7, 8</a>): God is unfathomable and mysterious. This very fact speaks ironically against Bildad’s and Zophar’s mechanical retribution theology, making space for an unexpected relationship between suffering and righteousness.

**Consider This:** In what ways have you experienced moments in your life when God did not react the way He was “supposed to”?

2. **II. Defending God** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Mark 15:3–5">Mark 15:3–5</a> with the class.)

Job’s friends felt very strongly about defending God; their arguments are the prototype of Christian apologetics. However, in their passionate defense, they forgot that God does not need our feeble human efforts to defend Him.

We see this larger truth played out in the Gospel narrative of <a class="verse" verse="Mark 15:3–5">Mark 15:3–5</a>. Jesus stands before Pilate, accused and beaten. Two times, Mark records that Jesus says nothing. In a related manner, when God finally begins to speak in <a class="verse" verse="Job 38">Job 38</a>, He never answers any of the myriad questions that Job has fired off toward Him throughout the book. He remains silent, as it were, on those questions.

There is a quote, which in its various forms has been attributed alternatively to Martin Luther, Oswald Chambers, and Charles Spurgeon (with the last one being the most likely author): “The gospel is like a caged lion. It does not need to be defended, it just needs to be let out of its cage.” We do not need to defend God. Any attempts to do so are doomed to fail miserably and often are only a poor self-defense of our own warped theologies. We do need to give reason for our faith, though, as the Bible instructs (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 3:15">1 Pet. 3:15</a>). There is a need for Christian apologetics, too, but not for human defenders of the Almighty, whose limits we cannot probe (<a class="verse" verse="Job 11:7–9">Job 11:7–9</a>).

**Consider This**: When have you ever felt the need to defend God? How did it go?
   
3. **III. God Actively Punishing the Wicked** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Exod 15:7; Exod 22:22; Exod 32:10">Exod 15:7; Exod 22:22; Exod 32:10</a>; , <a class="verse" verse="Numbers 16">Numbers 16</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Revelation 18:8">Revelation 18:8</a>, and 19:15 with the class.)

There are a number of people who take issue with such stories as Sodom and Gomorrah, the destruction of the sons of Korah, or the Exodus plagues (or the plagues at the end of time), in which God seems to be directly and actively involved in the punishment of the wicked, meting out His wrath upon those who have deliberately and repeatedly opposed Him, until His mercy has come to an end. In order to reconcile this picture with a God of love, the suggestion has been made to understand God’s wrath in terms of the impersonal, inevitable consequence of sin. This idea entails viewing punishment as the direct consequence of sin in which God’s only active role is in withdrawing His protection from the sinner.

This model begs a set of questions: Who alone could have established such an impersonal, universal law of punishment, if not God Himself? And more important: What about the consistently active descriptions of God’s wrath in the Bible that He personally enacts upon the punished? Within the great controversy, sin has originated on a personal level with Satan. The end of sin—whether it be through the direct punishments in the Bible that foreshadow the final judgment or the final resolution of sin at the end of time—is also brought about by a personal being, a God who is actively involved in the work of salvation. And lest we forget: God’s judgment always is inextricably connected to His mercy.
   
**Consider This**: How do you feel about God’s actively punishing the wicked with His wrath? Why do you feel this way?

#### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: There is a very practical aspect to the idea of God’s being active in punishment, and that is the question of how to relate His active role as Punisher of sin to a loving God.

**Thought/Application Questions:**

1. How do you feel about God’s destroying Satan and all evil at the end of history at the second resurrection?
2. How can you integrate divine punishment into the image of a loving God?

#### STEP 4—Create
**Just for Teachers**: There is suffering all around us, and we don’t have to go far to discover it. As a matter of fact, we should go out and discover it more often. This might keep us from falling into the temptation of retribution theology.

**Class/Individual Activities:**

- Visit a place of suffering in your community (for example, a hospice or a hospital) and reach out to the people who experience suffering right now.
- What were the words or actions you shared that provided hope for the people you came into contact with? Share next week with the class.
