### More Accusations

As if getting a lecture from Eliphaz weren’t bad enough, Job then faced one from Bildad, who said something similar to what Eliphaz had said. Unfortunately, Bildad was cruder and harsher toward Job than even Eliphaz was. Imagine going up to someone whose children had died and saying to the person: “ ‘If your sons have sinned against Him, He has cast them away for their transgression’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Job 8:4">Job 8:4</a>, NKJV).

This is ironic, because the first chapter of Job (<a class="verse" verse="Job 1:5">Job 1:5</a>) makes it clear that Job offered sacrifices on behalf of his children for that very reason, in case they had sinned. So we see a contrast here between an understanding of grace (as seen in Job’s actions) and Bildad’s opening words, which reveal a harsh, retributive legalism. Even worse, though, is that Bildad speaks this way in his attempt to defend the character of God.

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Job 8:1–22">Job 8:1–22</a>. What is Bildad’s argument, and how much truth is he speaking? That is, if you were to forget the immediate context and just look at the sentiments expressed, what fault, if any, could you find with his words?`

Who can find fault with so much of what he is saying here? “ ‘For we were born yesterday, and know nothing, because our days on earth are a shadow’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Job 8:9">Job 8:9</a>, NKJV). That’s powerful, true, and very biblical (<a class="verse" verse="James 4:14">James 4:14</a>). Or what’s wrong with his warning that the godless man who puts his hope in earthly, worldly things is really trusting in something no firmer than a “spider’s web” (<a class="verse" verse="Job 8:14">Job 8:14</a>)? That’s about as biblical a thought as one could get.

Perhaps the biggest problem is that Bildad is presenting just one aspect of God’s character. It’s an example of being in a ditch on one side of the road or the other. Neither place is where you really should be. Someone can, for instance, focus only on law and justice and obedience, while someone else can focus on grace and forgiveness and substitution. Either overemphasis usually leads to a distorted picture of God and of truth. We see a similar problem here.

`As humans we should always strive for the right balance between law and grace in our theology and in our dealing with others. If, however, you were to err on one side or the other (and as humans we eventually do), which side would it be better to err on when dealing with the faults of others, and why?`
