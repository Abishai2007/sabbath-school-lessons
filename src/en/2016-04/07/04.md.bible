### Divine Retribution

Job’s three friends undoubtedly had some knowledge about God. And they were earnest in their efforts to defend Him too. And, as we saw, as misguided as their words to Job were (especially given the context), these men were expressing some crucial truths.

Central to their arguments was the idea that God is a God of justice, and that sin brings divine retributive punishment upon evil and special blessings upon goodness. Though we don’t know the exact time that the men lived, we accept that Moses wrote the book of Job while he was in Midian, so they lived some time before the Exodus. Most likely, too, they lived after the Flood.

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 6:5–8">Genesis 6:5–8</a>. Though we don’t know how much these men (Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar) knew about the Flood, how might its story have influenced their theology?`

Clearly the story of the Flood is an example of divine retribution for sin. In it, God brings punishment directly upon those who specifically deserved it. Yet, even here the concept of grace is revealed as seen in <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 6:8">Genesis 6:8</a>. Ellen G. White wrote, too, of the fact that “every [hammer] blow struck upon the ark was preaching to the people.”—The Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 1, p. 70. Nevertheless, to some degree we can see in this story an example of what these men were preaching to Job.

`How is this same idea of retributive judgment seen in <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 13:13; 18:20–32; 19:24, 25">Genesis 13:13; 18:20–32; 19:24, 25</a>?`

`Whether or not Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar knew much about these incidents, they reveal the reality of God’s direct judgment upon evil. God wasn’t simply abandoning sinners to their sin and letting that sin itself destroy them. As with the Flood, God was the direct agent of their punishment. He functioned here as the judge and destroyer of wickedness and evil.`
