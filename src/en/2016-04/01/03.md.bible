The book of Job concluded with things going well for Job, who died “old and full of days.” As we all know, and know all too well, that’s not how the story ends for so many others. Even those who were faithful and honorable and virtuous didn’t always wind up in a situation such as Job’s.

How did the story end for the following Bible characters? Abel (<a class="verse" verse="Gen 4:8">Gen. 4:8</a>)

```Uriah (<a class="verse" verse="2 Sam 11:17">2 Sam. 11:17</a>)```

```Eli (<a class="verse" verse="1 Sam 4:18">1 Sam. 4:18</a>)```

```King Josiah (<a class="verse" verse="2 Chron 35:22–24">2 Chron. 35:22–24</a>)```

```John the Baptist (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 14:10">Matt. 14:10</a>)```

```Stephen (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 7:59, 60">Acts 7:59, 60</a>)```

As we can see, the Bible is full of stories that don’t have happy end- ings. And that’s because life itself is full of stories that don’t have happy endings. Whether martyred for a good cause, or dying from a horrible disease, or having a life reduced to pain and misery, many people don’t come through their trials as triumphant as Job did. In fact, to be honest, how often do things work out well, as they did for Job? And we don’t need the Bible to know this terrible fact. Who among us doesn’t know of unhappy endings?
