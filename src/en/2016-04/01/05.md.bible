Among other things, the Bible is a book about history. But it is not just a history book. It tells about events in the past, historical events, and uses them (among other things) to give us spiritual lessons. It uses events in the past to teach us truths about how we are to live in the here and now. (See <a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 10:11">1 Cor. 10:11</a>.)

But the Bible doesn’t just talk about the past. It talks about the future as well. It tells us not just about events that have happened but about events that will happen. It points us to the future, even to the end of time. The theological term for last-day events, about end times, is “eschatology,” from a Greek word that means “last.” Sometimes it is used to encompass belief about death, judgment, heaven, and hell as well. It also deals with the promise of hope that we have of a new existence in a new world.

And the Bible does tell us many things about the end times. Yes, the book of Job ended with Job’s death, and if this were the only book one had to read, one could believe that Job’s story ended, as do all ours, with death—and that was it, period. There was nothing else to hope for, because, as far as we can tell and from all that we see, nothing comes after.

The Bible, though, teaches us something else. It teaches that at the end of time God’s eternal kingdom will be established, it will exist forever, and it will be the eternal home of the redeemed. Unlike the worldly kingdoms that have come and gone, this one is everlasting.

```Read <a class="verse" verse="Daniel 2:44, 7:18">Daniel 2:44, 7:18</a>. What hope do these texts point to about the end?```

“The great plan of redemption results in fully bringing back the world into God’s favor. All that was lost by sin is restored. Not only man but the earth is redeemed, to be the eternal abode of the obedient. For six thousand years Satan has struggled to maintain possession of the earth. Now God’s original purpose in its creation is accomplished. ‘The saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.’ <a class="verse" verse="Daniel 7:18">Daniel 7:18</a>.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 342.

Indeed, the book of Job ended with his death. The good news for us, and for Job, is that the end of the book of Job is not the end of Job’s story. And our death is not the end of ours, either.
