            'Revelation 20, 21': "<h3>Revelation 20 </h3><div>\n<h3><span>Satan Bound 1,000 Years</span></h3><p><span><span>20&#xA0;</span>Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>He laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is <i>the</i> Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years; </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while.</span></p> <h3><span>The Saints Reign with Christ 1,000 Years</span></h3><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them. Then <i>I saw</i> the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received <i>his</i> mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This <i>is</i> the first resurrection. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Blessed and holy <i>is</i> he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.</span></p> <h3><span>Satanic Rebellion Crushed</span></h3><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Now when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number <i>is</i> as the sand of the sea. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet <i>are.</i> And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</span></p> <h3><span>The Great White Throne Judgment</span></h3><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And there was found no place for them. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is <i>the Book</i> of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.</span></p> <!--end of footnotes-->\n</div><h3>Revelation 21 </h3><div>\n<h3><span>All Things Made New</span></h3><p><span><span>21&#xA0;</span>Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, &#x201C;Behold, the tabernacle of God <i>is</i> with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them <i>and be</i> their God. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Then He who sat on the throne said, &#x201C;Behold, I make all things new.&#x201D; And He said to me, &#x201C;Write, for these words are true and faithful.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And He said to me, &#x201C;It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End.

Her light <i>was</i> like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Also she had a great and high wall with twelve gates, and twelve angels at the gates, and names written on them, which are <i>the names</i> of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.</span></p> <p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Now the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And he who talked with me had a gold reed to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>The city is laid out as a square; its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed: twelve thousand furlongs. Its length, breadth, and height are equal. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Then he measured its wall: one hundred <i>and</i> forty-four cubits, <i>according</i> to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>The construction of its wall was <i>of</i> jasper; and the city <i>was</i> pure gold, like clear glass. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>The foundations of the wall of the city <i>were</i> adorned with all kinds of precious stones: the first foundation <i>was</i> jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>The twelve gates <i>were</i> twelve pearls: each individual gate was of one pearl. And the street of the city <i>was</i> pure gold, like transparent glass.</span></p> <h3><span>The Glory of the New Jerusalem</span></h3><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it. The Lamb <i>is</i> its light. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And the nations of those who are saved shall walk in its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Its gates shall not be shut at all by day (there shall be no night there). </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it. </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>But there shall by no means enter it anything that defiles, or causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb&#x2019;s Book of Life.</span></p> <!--end of footnotes-->\n</div>"

for they all are the work of his hands.</span></p> <p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</span></p> <p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</span></p> <p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span></p> <p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.</span></p> <p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</span></p> <p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</span></p> <p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</span></p> <p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</span></p> <p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</span></p> <p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:</span></p> <p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</span></p> <p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</span></p> <p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</span></p> <p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</span></p> <p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</span></p> <p><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.</span></p> <p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.</span></p> <p><span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</span></p> <p><span><span>35&#xA0;</span>Elihu spake moreover, and said,</span></p> <p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God&apos;s?</span></p> <p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?</span></p> <p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</span></p> <p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.</span></p> <p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</span></p> <p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</span></p> <p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.</span></p> <p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</span></p> <p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;</span></p> <p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</span></p> <p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</span></p> <p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</span></p> <p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.</span></p> <p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:</span></p> <p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</span></p> <p><span><span>36&#xA0;</span>Elihu also proceeded, and said,</span></p> <p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God&apos;s behalf.</span></p> <p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</span></p> <p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</span></p> <p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.</span></p> <p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</span></p> <p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</span></p> <p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;</span></p> <p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</span></p> <p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</span></p> <p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</span></p> <p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</span></p> <p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</span></p> <p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</span></p> <p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</span></p> <p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.</span></p> <p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.</span></p> <p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</span></p> <p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</span></p> <p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</span></p> <p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</span></p> <p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</span></p> <p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</span></p> <p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</span></p> <p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.</span></p> <p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</span></p> <p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</span></p> <p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.</span></p> <p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?</span></p> <p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</span></p> <p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</span></p> <p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.</span></p> <p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.</span></p> <p><span><span>37&#xA0;</span>At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.</span></p> <p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</span></p> <p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</span></p> <p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</span></p> <p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</span></p> <p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</span></p> <p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</span></p> <p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</span></p> <p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</span></p> <p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</span></p> <p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:</span></p> <p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.</span></p> <p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</span></p> <p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</span></p> <p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</span></p> <p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</span></p> <p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?</span></p> <p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?</span></p> <p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</span></p> <p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Shall it be told him that I speak?

            'James 4:6': "<h3>James 4:6</h3><div>\n<p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</span></p></div>"
            'Job 38:1': "<h3>Job 38:1</h3><div>\n<p><span><span>38&#xA0;</span>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</span></p></div>"

### _The Lesson in Brief_

**Key Texts**: <a class="verse" verse="Job 32:1–5">Job 32:1–5</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Ezekiel 28:12–17">Ezekiel 28:12–17</a>

#### **The Student Will:**
- **Know:** Analyze Elihu’s speech from its promising beginning to its disappointing end.
- **Feel:** Sense the vexing nature of the origin of evil and the impossibility of explaining it adequately.
- **Do:** Approach the big questions of life with a good dose of humility, especially in answering them for other people.

#### **Learning Outline:**
1. Know: The Pitfalls of Youthful Anger
   + **A** What was hopeful about the beginning of young Elihu’s speech—a speech that is subsequently marred by impatience and anger?
   + **B** How does Elihu’s conclusion relate to the answers that the three other friends provided to Job’s suffering?
2. Feel: The Inexplicable
   + **A** How can we explain that the most perfect being ever created, Lucifer, turned his back on his Creator?
   + **B** In light of our answer to the preceding question, why, then, do we try again and again to explain the inexplicable, that is, the suffering in our lives and around us?
3. Do: Practicing Humility
   + **A** What is the opposite of humility, and where has it shown up in the great controversy?
   + **B** What role does our own humility play in the response to suffering and the pursuit of truth?
 
**Summary:** When Elihu appears on the scene, there seems to be a breeze of fresh air. He is young and angry, waiting for his turn to arrive. However, he also lacks humility, and at the end of the day his words are no different from the other friends. Evil remains inexplicable, and only a humble faith can give us hope.

#### **Learning Cycle**

#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: <a class="verse" verse="Job 28:28, 32:1–5">Job 28:28, 32:1–5</a>

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Elihu’s speech promises to be different, but he falls into the same theological trap of retribution theology as Job’s other friends. His words are angry, hurtful, and characterized by a spiritual pride that actually plays into the hands of God’s enemy, whose initial fall was caused by lack of humility and angelic pride. Only a humble approach to the question of suffering can provide honest answers that are grounded in the fear of the Lord.

**Just for Teachers**: As we look around our churches worldwide, we can perceive that there is a generational conflict playing out. Studies have shown that the church in North America is especially susceptible to not engaging Millenials (those reaching young adulthood around the year 2000). In other places in this world, there are a lot of young people in the church, but very few of them are participating in the leadership of the church, which is reserved for the old and experienced. Discuss with your class how the relationship between young and old (and the in-betweens) plays out in your local church.

**Opening Discussion**: Finally, some young blood with some new perspectives! Finally, somebody who will put things right and fight against the theological establishment! This is the feeling one gets when Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, appears out of nowhere and angrily starts his discourse.

Anger often has been the motivating power of youth. Anger against the established opinions on war, racial segregation, economics, social injustice, and so on, has motivated protest movements worldwide that mainly have been spearheaded by younger generations. A lot of these movements also have brought positive changes to society. Elihu’s is not a political agenda but a theological one. His approach was anger paired with a good dose of impatience (<a class="verse" verse="Job 32:4, 5">Job 32:4, 5</a>). His appearance definitely causes a stir.

How do you see the power of youth playing out in your church? What can the youth do that their elders cannot accomplish? What role does anger play here?

#### STEP 2—Explore
**Just for Teachers**: Ellen G. White has some significant statements about the “army of youth” in our church, which can be summarized in the following quote: “With such an army of workers as our youth, rightly trained, might furnish, how soon the message of a crucified, risen, and soon-coming Saviour might be carried to the whole world!”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 271; compare Christian Service, p. 30. It would be interesting to see how this “army of youth” is present in your church. How visible is it, and in which direction is it marching? Read some of the other quotes in Christian Service to your class.

### **Bible Commentary**

Elihu’s message spans six chapters in the book of Job (<a class="verse" verse="Job 32–37">Job 32–37</a>), the longest continuous speech of the whole book. It follows after Job’s words end (<a class="verse" verse="Job 31:40">Job 31:40</a>) and is motivated by a fourfold statement about his anger in the prose introduction to his speech (<a class="verse" verse="Job 32:1–5">Job 32:1–5</a>) that deserves a comment: Elihu understands Job’s plea of innocence as an attempt at arrogant self-justification. He is also angry with the three friends who fail to convince Job of his guilt. His whole speech is born out of anger, which isn’t a good point of departure for any argument, even if it is presented as holy and righteous wrath.

1. **Elihu’s Speech** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Job 32–37">Job 32–37</a> with the class.)

Elihu’s appearance is marked by an illustrious ancestry that possibly connects him to Abraham (Buz was Abraham’s nephew, <a class="verse" verse="Gen 22:21">Gen. 22:21</a>) and even makes him a forefather of David (Ram was an ancestor of David, <a class="verse" verse="Ruth 4:19">Ruth 4:19</a>). He is definitely a Hebrew in contrast to the three friends, who are Edomites. Thus, Elihu begins his speech by claiming direct divine inspiration (<a class="verse" verse="Job 32:6–10">Job 32:6–10</a>), which finally moves him to speak against the older and presumably wiser men (<a class="verse" verse="Job 32:11–22">Job 32:11–22</a>).

In chapter 33, Elihu sums up Job’s previous speeches and promises restoration to him if he listens to what he has to say. The suspense is almost unbearable at this point, and one expects the answers to all of Job’s sufferings. However, chapter 34 is almost anticlimactic in presenting Elihu’s solution, which, in the final analysis, coincides exactly with what the other three friends have suggested—God repays everybody in accordance to his or her deeds (<a class="verse" verse="Job 34:10–15">Job 34:10–15</a>). Retribution theology once more! And, worse, Elihu added rebellion to Job’s sins (<a class="verse" verse="Job 34:36, 37">Job 34:36, 37</a>) in insisting on his innocence.

Chapters 35 and 36 paint a dismal picture of God, describing Him as a distant Being, far removed from the human sphere and not interested in the individual lives of humanity. Interestingly, Elihu uses storm imagery in the last chapter of his speech (<a class="verse" verse="Job 37">Job 37</a>), claiming that he speaks for God, only to stand corrected when Yahweh then really speaks, in chapters 38–41, out of the true divine storm (<a class="verse" verse="Job 38:1">Job 38:1</a>). At the end of Elihu’s speech one cannot but think: a lot of words, a lot of wind, but nothing substantial that could provide any answers—a big disappointment.

**Consider This:** Was Elihu’s angry approach justified? Why, or why not?

2. **II. Nonsense** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Ezekiel 28:12–17">Ezekiel 28:12–17</a> with the class.)

<a class="verse" verse="Ezekiel 28">Ezekiel 28</a>, usually in connection with <a class="verse" verse="Isaiah 14">Isaiah 14</a>, is used to study the origin of evil, as well as the fall of Satan. Indeed, the Bible study guide has studied these texts before in this context. However, there is one other aspect that arises from this epic lament that initially seems to describe the King of Tyre. (Tyre was a Phoenician city famous for its involvement in the cruel Mediterranean slave trade.) But then it turns toward a more universal and cosmic tone that goes far beyond the description of an earthly king. It becomes a description of Lucifer in heaven, the most perfect being ever created. The text does not leave any doubt about the incredible beauty of the “anointed cherub” who resides on the holy mountain of God. This scene is then set in stark contrast to the deepest fall a created being could ever experience. From the very presence of God into the depth of demonic depravity, Satan’s fate will eventually end in a lonely millennium and ultimate destruction (<a class="verse" verse="Revelation 20, 21">Revelation 20, 21</a>).

This does not make sense! And this is exactly the point. Sin and suffering do not make any sense; they are nonsensical. We could rationalize them away, but to do so would be to excuse or defend sin. So, in this vein, all the intentions of the three friends, plus Elihu, to make sense of Job’s suffering are doomed to failure. As a matter of fact, God eventually declares them to have sinned themselves through their speeches. Maybe we, too, should no longer try to explain the nonsensical.

**Consider This**: Why could rationalizing sin and suffering eventually lead us into sin ourselves?
   
3. **III. Humility and Truth** (Review <a class="verse" verse="Psalm 45:4">Psalm 45:4</a> and <a class="verse" verse="James 4:6">James 4:6</a> with the class.)

A beautiful coronation psalm wishes the following characteristics onto the newly crowned king: “truth, humility and justice” (<a class="verse" verse="Ps 45:4">Ps. 45:4</a>, NIV). The pursuit of truth needs to be connected to humility, and only the humble will find truth, because he stands ready to be corrected. Elihu displays the opposite quality; that is, arrogance and pride; and it is exactly these that hinder him (and the three other friends) from coming any closer to truth. God gives grace to the humble but strongly opposes the proud (<a class="verse" verse="James 4:6">James 4:6</a>). Pride brings us right back to the fallen cherub.
   
**Consider This**: Is it possible to claim to have the truth, as we as Seventhday Adventists sometimes do, and still be humble? Explain.

#### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Elihu’s extended speech is a big disappointment, although it starts out promising. We need to find practical ways to help us avoid the trap Elihu fell into, otherwise we will also be going in circles.

**Thought/Application Questions:**

1. `How can we differentiate righteous wrath from a self-righteous anger?`
2. `How can we keep from falling into the same trap as Elihu, who just rehashed the other friends’ arguments and added his self-righteous wrath to it?`

#### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: Elihu’s young radicalism was more illusion than reality, and his extended speech ends up being a big disappointment.

**Class/Individual Activities:**

Bring to class a beautiful container (for example, a silver cup with a lid) and let your students admire it. Then open it and show the inside of it, which should be prepared beforehand with some offensively rotten food. Read <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 23:27, 28">Matthew 23:27, 28</a> and discuss with your class their reaction when you opened the lid.
