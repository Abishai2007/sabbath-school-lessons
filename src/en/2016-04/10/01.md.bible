            'Job 1–2:10': "<h3>Job 1-2:10</h3><div>\n<h3><span>Job and His Family in Uz</span></h3><p><span><span>1&#xA0;</span>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <i>was</i> Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And seven sons and three daughters were born to him. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East.</span></p> <p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And his sons would go and feast <i>in their</i> houses, each on his <i>appointed</i> day, and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings <i>according to</i> the number of them all. For Job said, &#x201C;It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.&#x201D; Thus Job did regularly.</span></p> <h3><span>Satan Attacks Job&#x2019;s Character</span></h3><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, and Satan also came among them. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;From where do you come?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>So Satan answered the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> and said, &#x201C;From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;Have you considered My servant Job, that <i>there is</i> none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>So Satan answered the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> and said, &#x201C;Does Job fear God for nothing? </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;Behold, all that he has <i>is</i> in your power; only do not lay a hand on his <i>person.</i>&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>So Satan went out from the presence of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>.</span></p> <h3><span>Job Loses His Property and Children</span></h3><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Now there was a day when his sons and daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother&#x2019;s house; </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>and a messenger came to Job and said, &#x201C;The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>when the Sabeans raided <i>them</i> and took them away&#x2014;indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, &#x201C;The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, &#x201C;The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, &#x201C;Your sons and daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother&#x2019;s house, </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell to the ground and worshiped. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And he said:</span></p><div><p><span>&#x201C;Naked I came from my mother&#x2019;s womb,</span><br><span>And naked shall I return there.</span><br><span>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> gave, and the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> has taken away;</span><br><span>Blessed be the name of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>.&#x201D;</span></p></div> <p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong.</span></p> <h3><span>Satan Attacks Job&#x2019;s Health</span></h3><p><span><span>2&#xA0;</span>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;From where do you come?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Satan answered the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> and said, &#x201C;From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;Have you considered My servant Job, that <i>there is</i> none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>So Satan answered the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> and said, &#x201C;Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will surely curse You to Your face!&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;Behold, he <i>is</i> in your hand, but spare his life.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>So Satan went out from the presence of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes.</span></p> <p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then his wife said to him, &#x201C;Do you still hold fast to your integrity?

### The Wrath of Elihu
#### Read for This Week’s Study:
<a class="verse" verse="Job 13:28">Job 13:28</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Job 28:28">Job 28:28</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Job 32:1–5">Job 32:1–5</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Job 34:10–15">Job 34:10–15</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Ezek 28:12–17">Ezek. 28:12–17</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Job 1–2:10">Job 1–2:10</a>.

> <p>Memory Text:</p>
> “ ‘For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Isaiah 55:9">Isaiah 55:9</a>, NKJV).

And so it goes, the battle of words between Job and these three men, words that at times are profound, beautiful, deep, and true. How often people will quote from the book of Job, even quotes from Eliphaz, Bildad, or Zophar. And that’s because, as we have seen again and again, they did have a lot of good things to say. They just didn’t say them in the right place, at the right time, in the right circumstances. What this should teach us is the powerful truth of these texts in <a class="verse" verse="Proverbs 25:11–13">Proverbs 25:11–13</a>:

<div style="padding: 20px; font-style: italics"> 
<div>A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold</div>
<div>In settings of silver.</div>
<div>Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold</div>
<div>Is a wise rebuker to an obedient ear.</div>
<div>Like the cold of snow in time of harvest</div>
<div>Is a faithful messenger to those who send him,</div>
<div>For he refreshes the soul of his masters (NKJV).</div>
</div>

Unfortunately, those weren’t the words that Job was hearing from his friends. In fact, the problem was going to get worse because, instead of just three people telling him he’s wrong, a new one comes on the scene.
