The book of Job pulls back a veil and reveals a dimension of exis- tence that our eyes and ears and worldly philosophies could never show us. (If anything, these texts should show us just how limited our eyes and ears and worldly philosophies are when it comes to understand- ing the big picture!) And what these few texts show, too, is a conflict between God and this other being, Satan. And though the controversy is first introduced in the book of Job as taking place in heaven, it quickly shifts to the earth. All through the Bible, we find texts that point to this ongoing conflict, one that involves us, as well.

Read the following texts. How do they reveal the reality of a conflict being fought here on earth with evil supernatural powers?

```<a class="verse" verse="Gen 3:1–4">Gen. 3:1–4</a>```

```<a class="verse" verse="Zech 3:2">Zech. 3:2</a>```

```<a class="verse" verse="Matt 4:1">Matt. 4:1</a>```

```<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 5:8">1 Pet. 5:8</a>```

```<a class="verse" verse="1 John 3:8">1 John 3:8</a>```

```<a class="verse" verse="Rev 12:9">Rev. 12:9</a>```

These texts are just a small sampling of numerous texts that point, either explicitly or implicitly, to a literal devil, a supernatural being with mali- cious intentions. Though many people view the idea of Satan as a primitive myth, with such clear Bible testimony we should not fall for this deception.

```What are ways that, even now, you see the reality of Satan’s work in our world? What is our only protection?```
