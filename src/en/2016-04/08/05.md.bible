### Sufficient for the Day . . .

Read the following verses and think about the immediate fate of those depicted in the texts. Then ask yourself the question: How fairly was life treating them?

`<a class="verse" verse="Job 1:18–20">Job 1:18–20</a>`

`<a class="verse" verse="Gen 4:8">Gen. 4:8</a>`

`<a class="verse" verse="Exod 12:29, 30">Exod. 12:29, 30</a>`

`<a class="verse" verse="2 Sam 11:17">2 Sam. 11:17</a>`

`<a class="verse" verse="Jer 38:6">Jer. 38:6</a>`

`<a class="verse" verse="Matt 14:10">Matt. 14:10</a>`

`<a class="verse" verse="Heb 11:35–38">Heb. 11:35–38</a>`

The Bible reflects a harsh fact about life in our fallen world: evil and suffering are real. It’s only a superficial reading of the Word of God, pulling a few texts out of the whole context, that could give anyone the idea that life here is fair and just and good, and that if only we remain faithful to God, suffering won’t come. Certainly faithfulness can reap great rewards now, but that doesn’t mean it provides an absolute barrier to suffering and pain. Just ask Job.

In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus gave a powerful homily on why we need to trust God and not to worry about what we will eat, or drink, or wear. And Jesus used examples from nature as object lessons on why we can trust in God’s goodness to meet our needs. He then included these famous words: “Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 6:34">Matt. 6:34</a>).

Notice, sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. Jesus wasn’t denying the presence in our lives, even the daily presence, of evil (from a Greek word that can mean “badness,” “depravity,” and “malignity”). If anything, He was doing the opposite. He was acknowledging the prevalence and presence of evil in our daily lives. How could He not? As the Lord, He knew more about the evil in the world than any of us ever could, and all of us certainly know a lot about it already.
       
`Who hasn’t tasted a bit (or maybe a lot) of just how unfair and bitter life can be? How can focusing on Jesus’ acknowledgment of this evil’s reality help to give us comfort and strength amid it?`
