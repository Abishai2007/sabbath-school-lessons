### Innocent Blood?

We often hear the question of “innocent” suffering. The Bible even uses the phrase “innocent blood” (<a class="verse" verse="Isa 59:7">Isa. 59:7</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Jer 22:17">Jer. 22:17</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Joel 3:19">Joel 3:19</a>), usually in the context of assault, or even murder, of people who didn’t deserve what happened to them. If we use this understanding of “innocent blood,” then, as we all know, our world is filled with many examples of it.

On the other hand, the Bible does talk about the reality of human sinfulness and human corruption, which brings up a valid question about the meaning of “innocent.” If everyone has sinned, if everyone has violated God’s law, then who is truly innocent? As someone once said, “Your birth certificate is proof of your guilt.”

Though theologians and Bible scholars for centuries have debated the exact nature of the human relationship to sin, the Bible is clear that sin has impacted all humanity. The idea of human sinfulness is not found only in the New Testament. On the contrary, the New Testament exploration of the theme expands on what was written in the Old Testament.

`What do the following texts teach about the reality of sin? <a class="verse" verse="1 Kings 8:46">1 Kings 8:46</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Ps 51:5">Ps. 51:5</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Prov 20:9">Prov. 20:9</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Isa 53:6">Isa. 53:6</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Rom 3:10–20">Rom. 3:10–20</a>.`

Besides the clear testimony of Scripture, anyone who has ever known the Lord personally, who has seen a glimpse of God’s goodness and holiness, knows the reality of human sinfulness. In that sense, who among us (we’re going to skip, for now, the whole question of babies and young children) is truly “innocent”?

On the other hand, that’s not really the point. Job was a sinner; in that sense he wasn’t innocent, any more than his own children weren’t innocent. And yet, what had he done, or they done, to deserve the fate that befell them? Is this not, perhaps, the ultimate question for humanity in regard to suffering? Contrary to his friends’ “defenses of clay” (<a class="verse" verse="Job 13:12">Job 13:12</a>, NKJV), Job knew that what was happening to him was not something that he deserved.
   
`How does the experience of knowing God and His holiness, which makes our own sinfulness painful, help us to see our absolute need of the Cross?`
