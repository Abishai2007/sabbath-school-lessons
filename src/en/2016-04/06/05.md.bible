### The Foolish Taking Root

In chapter 5, Eliphaz continues with his argument. It’s mostly the same as what he said in the previous chapter: evil happens only to evil people. Imagine how this must have felt to Job, who knew that it couldn’t be right and that he didn’t deserve his present situation.

However, there is a problem here: not all that Eliphaz is saying here is wrong. On the contrary, many of these same thoughts are echoed in other parts of the Bible.

How do the following texts reflect the sentiments expressed in <a class="verse" verse="Job 5">Job 5</a>? <a class="verse" verse="Ps 37:10">Ps. 37:10</a>

```<a class="verse" verse="Prov 26:2">Prov. 26:2</a>```

```<a class="verse" verse="Luke 1:52">Luke 1:52</a>```

```<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 3:19">1 Cor. 3:19</a>```

```<a class="verse" verse="Ps 34:6">Ps. 34:6</a>```

```<a class="verse" verse="Heb 12:5">Heb. 12:5</a>```
