#### Further Thought:

From cover to cover, the Bible is filled with wonderful words of hope. “ ‘These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="John 16:33">John 16:33</a>, NKJV). “ ‘I am with you always, even to the end of the age’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 28:20">Matt. 28:20</a>, NKJV). “Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us” (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 3:13">Gal. 3:13</a>, NKJV). “As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us” (<a class="verse" verse="Ps 103:12">Ps. 103:12</a>, NKJV). “For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord” (<a class="verse" verse="Rom 8:38, 39">Rom. 8:38, 39</a>, NKJV). “ ‘The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will look on it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Gen 9:16">Gen. 9:16</a>, NKJV). “Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God! Therefore the world does not know us, because it did not know Him” (<a class="verse" verse="1 John 3:1">1 John 3:1</a>, NKJV). “Know that the Lord, He is God; it is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people and the sheep of His pasture” (<a class="verse" verse="Ps 100:3">Ps. 100:3</a>, NKJV). These texts are just a small portion of what is revealed to us in the Word about what our God is like and what He offers us. What reasons would we have for hope at all, were it not from what is revealed to us in the Bible?

#### Discussion Questions:

- `What other Bible texts speak to us of hope? Which ones are especially important to you, and why?`

- `Of all the specific doctrines of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which ones do you find especially hopeful?`

- `Amid the personal trials and sometimes tragedies and hardships of life, how can we learn to rejoice in the hope that is presented to us in the Bible? Why is it so easy to get discouraged by events, even with so much hope presented to us? What can we do, on a practical level, to keep this hope ever before us and to rejoice in it?`

- `“Talk hope and faith and thanksgiving to God. Be cheerful, hopeful in Christ. Educate yourself to praise Him. This is a great remedy for diseases of the soul and of the body.”—Ellen G. White, Mind, Character, and Personality, vol. 2, p. 492. Why is praise so important in helping us to stay hopeful in the Lord?`
