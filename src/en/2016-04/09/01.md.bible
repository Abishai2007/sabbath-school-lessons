            '1 Cor 15:11–20': "<h3>1 Corinthians 15:11-20</h3><div>\n<p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, whether <i>it was</i> I or they, so we preach and so you believed.</span></p> <h3><span>The Risen Christ, Our Hope</span></h3><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching <i>is</i> empty and your faith <i>is</i> also empty. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up&#x2014;if in fact the dead do not rise. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>For if <i>the</i> dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>And if Christ is not risen, your faith <i>is</i> futile; you are still in your sins! </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable.</span></p> <h3><span>The Last Enemy Destroyed</span></h3><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>But now Christ is risen from the dead, <i>and</i> has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. </span></p></div>"
            '1 Pet 1:18–20': "<h3>1 Peter 1:18-20</h3><div>\n<p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, <i>like</i> silver or gold, from your aimless conduct <i>received</i> by tradition from your fathers, </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you </span></p></div>"
            'James 2:20–22': "<h3>James 2:20-22</h3><div>\n<p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead? </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect? </span></p> <!--end of footnotes-->\n</div>"

### Intimations of Hope

### Read for This Week’s Study: <a class="verse" verse="Prov 17:28">Prov. 17:28</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Job 13:1–15">Job 13:1–15</a>, <a class="verse" verse="James 2:20–22">James 2:20–22</a>, <a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 15:11–20">1 Cor. 15:11–20</a>, <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:18–20">1 Pet. 1:18–20</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Gen 22:8">Gen. 22:8</a>.

> <p>Memory Text:</p>
> “ ‘He also shall be my salvation, for a hypocrite could not come before Him’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Job 13:16">Job 13:16</a>, NKJV).

Man is the only animal,” wrote British essayist William Hazlitt, “that laughs and weeps; for he is the only animal that is struck with the difference between what things are, and what they ought to be.”

Things certainly aren’t what they ought to be. However, for a Christian who lives with the promise of the Second Coming, there is hope—a great hope of what things will become (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 3:13">2 Pet. 3:13</a>). They will become something so wonderful that we, with sin-darkened minds (<a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 13:12">1 Cor. 13:12</a>), can barely imagine it now. This is a hope that the secular mind, in all its narrowness and parochialism, has lost long ago.

This week, as we continue to explore the question of suffering in the book of Job, we will find that, even amid the unfair tragedy that befell him, which made no sense and was not justified, Job could still utter words of hope.

What was that hope, and what does it tell us that we can hope in as well?
