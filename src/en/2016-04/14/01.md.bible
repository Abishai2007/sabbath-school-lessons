            'Matt 13:39': '<h3> <span>Matthew 13:39</span></h3><p> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup><span>The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.</span> </span> </p>'
            'John 8:1–11': '<h3> <span>John 8:1-11</span></h3><p><span><span>8&#xA0;</span>But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Now early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him; and He sat down and taught them. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>they said to Him, &#x201C;Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>This they said, testing Him, that they might have <i>something</i> of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with <i>His</i> finger, as though He did not hear.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, <span>&#x201C;He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then those who heard <i>it,</i> being convicted by <i>their</i> conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest <i>even</i> to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, <span>&#x201C;Woman, where are those accusers of yours?</span><span> Has no one condemned you?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>She said, &#x201C;No one, Lord.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>And Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Neither do I condemn you; go and</span> <span>sin no more.&#x201D;</span></span></p>'
            '2 Cor 5:7': '<h3> <span>2 Corinthians 5:7</span></h3><p> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>For we walk by faith, not by sight. </span> </p>'
            'Matt 4:10': '<h3> <span>Matthew 4:10</span></h3><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;Away with you,</span><span> Satan! For it is written, &#x2018;You shall worship the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> your God, and Him only you shall serve.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></span></p>'
            'Heb 11:10': '<h3> <span>Hebrews 11:10</span></h3><p> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>for he waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker <i>is</i> God.</span></p>'
            'James 5:11': '<h3> <span>James 5:11</span></h3><p> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Indeed we count them blessed who endure. You have heard of the perseverance of Job and seen the end <i>intended by</i> the Lord&#x2014;that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful.</span></p>'
            'Job 1–2:8': '<h3> <span>Job 1:1-2:8</span></h3><p><span><span>1&#xA0;</span>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <i>was</i> Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And seven sons and three daughters were born to him. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And his sons would go and feast <i>in their</i> houses, each on his <i>appointed</i> day, and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings <i>according to</i> the number of them all. For Job said, &#x201C;It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.&#x201D; Thus Job did regularly.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and Satan also came among them. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;From where do you come?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>So Satan answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and said, &#x201C;From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;Have you considered My servant Job, that <i>there is</i> none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>So Satan answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and said, &#x201C;Does Job fear God for nothing? </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;Behold, all that he has <i>is</i> in your power; only do not lay a hand on his <i>person.</i>&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>So Satan went out from the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Now there was a day when his sons and daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother&#x2019;s house; </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>and a messenger came to Job and said, &#x201C;The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>when the Sabeans raided <i>them</i> and took them away&#x2014;indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, &#x201C;The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, &#x201C;The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, &#x201C;Your sons and daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother&#x2019;s house, </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell to the ground and worshiped. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And he said:</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Naked I came from my mother&#x2019;s womb,</span><br><span>And naked shall I return there.</span><br><span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> gave, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has taken away;</span><br><span>Blessed be the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong.</span></p><p><span><span>2&#xA0;</span>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;From where do you come?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Satan answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and said, &#x201C;From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#x201C;Have you considered My servant Job, that <i>there is</i> none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>So Satan answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and said, &#x201C;Skin for skin!

            'Heb 4:15': '<h3> <span>Hebrews 4:15</span></h3><p> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all <i>points</i> tempted as <i>we are, yet</i> without sin. </span> </p>'

### Some Lessons From Job

### Read for This Week’s Study:
<a class="verse" verse="2 Cor 5:7">2 Cor. 5:7</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Job 1–2:8">Job 1–2:8</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Matt 4:10">Matt. 4:10</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Matt 13:39">Matt. 13:39</a>, <a class="verse" verse="John 8:1–11">John 8:1–11</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Heb 11:10">Heb. 11:10</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Heb 4:15">Heb. 4:15</a>.

> <p>Memory Text:</p>
> “Indeed we count them blessed who endure. You have heard of the perseverance of Job and seen the end intended by the Lord—that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful” (<a class="verse" verse="James 5:11">James 5:11</a>, NKJV). 

We’ve come to the end of this quarter’s study on Job. Though we might have covered much in the book, we must admit that there’s still much more to cover, much more to learn. Of course, even in the secular world, everything we learn and discover simply leads to more things to learn and to discover. And if it’s like that with atoms, stars, jellyfish, and math equations, how much more so with the Word of God?

“We have no reason to doubt God’s word because we cannot understand the mysteries of His providence. In the natural world we are constantly surrounded with wonders beyond our comprehension. Should we then be surprised to find in the spiritual world also mysteries that we cannot fathom? The difficulty lies solely in the weakness and narrowness of the human mind.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 170. 

Yes, mysteries remain, especially in a book like Job, where many of life’s most difficult questions are raised. Nevertheless, we will look at some lessons we can take away from this story that can help us, like Job, to be faithful to the Lord amid a world of troubles.
