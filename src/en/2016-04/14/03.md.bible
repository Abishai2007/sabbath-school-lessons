### Evil Being

One of the great questions that has challenged human thinking deals with evil. Though some philosophers and even religionists have denied the existence of evil or think we should at least abandon the term, most people would disagree. Evil is real; it’s a part of this world. Though we can argue over what is or is not evil, most of us (to paraphrase a U.S. Supreme Court justice in another context) “know it when we see it.” 

Evil is sometimes put into two broad classes: natural and moral. Natural evil is defined as the kind that arises from natural disasters, such as when earthquakes or floods or pestilences bring suffering. Moral evil results from deliberate actions of other human beings, such as murder or robbery.

All sorts of theories, ancient and modern, attempt to account for the existence of evil. As Seventh-day Adventists, we believe that the Bible teaches that evil originated in the fall of a created being, Satan. The popular culture, aided by materialistic philosophical speculations, has denied the idea of Satan. But one can do so only by rejecting the clear testimony of Scripture, which depicts Satan as a real being out to do humans as much harm as possible. 

This is a truth especially revealed in the book of Job.

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Job 1:1">Job 1:1</a> to <a class="verse" verse="Job 2:8">Job 2:8</a>. How do these two chapters help us to understand the role of Satan in the evil that’s so prevalent in the world?`

In Job’s case, Satan was directly responsible for the evil, both moral and natural, that fell upon this man. But what we see in the book of Job doesn’t necessarily mean that every example of evil or suffering is directly related to demonic activity. The fact is, as with the characters in the book of Job, we just don’t know all the reasons for the terrible things that happen. In fact, the name of “Satan” never even came up in the dialogues regarding Job’s misfortunes. The speakers blamed God, they blamed Job, but never Satan himself. Nevertheless, the book of Job should show us who is responsible in the end for the evil on the earth.

`What do the following texts tell us about the reality of Satan? <a class="verse" verse="Rev 12:12">Rev. 12:12</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Matt 4:10">Matt. 4:10</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Matt 13:39">Matt. 13:39</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Luke 8:12">Luke 8:12</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Luke 13:16">Luke 13:16</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Luke 22:3, 31">Luke 22:3, 31</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Acts 5:3">Acts 5:3</a>; <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 5:8">1 Pet. 5:8</a>. More important, what examples do you have of Satan’s influence in your life? How can you be protected against him?`
