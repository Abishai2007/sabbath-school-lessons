### Jesus and Job 

Bible students through the ages have sought to find parallels between the story of Job and the story of Jesus. And though Job is not exactly a “type” of Jesus (as were the animals in the sacrificial system), some parallels do exist. In these parallels we can find another lesson from Job: that of what our salvation cost the Lord.

`Compare <a class="verse" verse="Job 1:1">Job 1:1</a> with <a class="verse" verse="1 John 2:1">1 John 2:1</a>, <a class="verse" verse="James 5:6">James 5:6</a>, and <a class="verse" verse="Acts 3:14">Acts 3:14</a>. What parallels are there?`

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 4:1–11">Matthew 4:1–11</a>. What parallels exist here between Jesus and Job?`

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 26:61">Matthew 26:61</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Luke 11:15, 16">Luke 11:15, 16</a>; and <a class="verse" verse="John 18:30">John 18:30</a>. How do these texts parallel the experience of Job?`

`Compare <a class="verse" verse="Job 1:22">Job 1:22</a> with <a class="verse" verse="Hebrews 4:15">Hebrews 4:15</a>. What parallel exists?`

These texts do reveal interesting parallels between the experiences of Job and Jesus. Job, of course, was not sinless, as was Jesus; nevertheless, he was a faithful and righteous man whose life brought glory to the Father. Job was sorely tested by the devil, as was Jesus. All through the book of Job, Job was falsely accused; Jesus, too, faced false accusations.

Finally, and perhaps most important, despite all that happened, Job stayed faithful to the Lord. Much more consequently for us all, Jesus stayed faithful as well. Despite everything that happened to Him, Jesus lived a sinless life, one that perfectly embodied the character of God. Jesus was the “express image of His [God’s] person” (<a class="verse" verse="Heb 1:3">Heb. 1:3</a>, NKJV), and thus alone had the righteousness needed for salvation, “even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference” (<a class="verse" verse="Rom 3:22">Rom. 3:22</a>).

As great as it all was, Job, his suffering, and his faithfulness amid the suffering was a small and imperfect reflection of what Jesus, his Redeemer, would face in Job’s behalf and in ours, when He will indeed come and “stand at the latter day upon the earth” (<a class="verse" verse="Job 19:25">Job 19:25</a>).
