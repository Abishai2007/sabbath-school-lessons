### The Son of Man

In the earliest chapters of Job, we were given a glimpse into the reality of the great controversy between Christ and Satan. As we know, it was a battle that started in heaven but eventually came to the earth (see <a class="verse" verse="Rev 12:7–12">Rev. 12:7–12</a>). In the book of Job we saw that same dynamic: a conflict in heaven that comes to earth. Unfortunately for Job, that particular conflict on earth centered on him.

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Job 10:4, 5">Job 10:4, 5</a>. What was Job’s complaint, and did he not have a point?`

Job’s point was simple. You are God, the Sovereign of the universe, the Creator. How can you know what it is like to be a human, to suffer the things that we suffer? 

`How do the following texts answer Job’s complaint? <a class="verse" verse="Luke 2:11">Luke 2:11</a>, <a class="verse" verse="John 1:14">John 1:14</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Luke 19:10">Luke 19:10</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Matt 4:2">Matt. 4:2</a>, <a class="verse" verse="1 Tim 2:5">1 Tim. 2:5</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Heb 4:15">Heb. 4:15</a>.`

Job’s complaint, that God wasn’t a human and therefore couldn’t know human woe, was answered fully and completely by the coming of Jesus into humanity. Though never losing His divinity, Jesus also was fully human, and in that humanity He knew what it was like to suffer and struggle, just as Job and all humans do. In fact, all through the Gospels, we see the reality of Christ’s humanity and the sufferings that He went through in our humanity. Jesus answered Job’s complaint.

“It was not a make-believe humanity that Christ took upon Himself. He took human nature and lived human nature. . . . He was not only made flesh, but He was made in the likeness of sinful flesh.”—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1124. 

`Think what it means that Jesus took humanity. What should this tell you about how closely He can relate to you in any of the struggles that you are facing right now?`
