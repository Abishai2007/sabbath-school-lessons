            'Gal 5:22, 23': '<h3> <span>Galatians 5:22</span></h3><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, </span> </p><h3> <span>Galatians 5:23</span></h3><p> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>gentleness, self-control.

            'Galatians 5': '<h3> <span>Galatians 5</span></h3><p><span><span>5&#xA0;</span>Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>You have become estranged from Christ, you who <i>attempt to</i> be justified by law; you have fallen from grace. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>You ran well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>This persuasion does not <i>come</i> from Him who calls you. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>A little leaven leavens the whole lump. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will have no other mind; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then the offense of the cross has ceased. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>I could wish that those who trouble you would even cut themselves off!</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not <i>use</i> liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, <i>even</i> in this: <span>&#x201C;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another!</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told <i>you</i> in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And those <i>who are</i> Christ&#x2019;s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</span></p>'

**Opinion**: <a class="verse" verse="Gal 2:15; Gal 2:16; Gal 5:22; Gal 5:23">Gal. 2:15; Gal. 2:16; Gal. 5:22; Gal. 5:23</a>; 

For psychologist Izzy Kalman, most of the world’s problems are caused by good intentions.1 The witch hunters of the Middle Ages burned tens of thousands of women to try to end epidemics. Even Hitler believed he was doing the right thing, making the world a better place without Jews and other people he thought were impure.

**Both matter.**

The same applies to our actions in the natural world. “In the 1970s, catfish farmers introduced Asian carp into their fisheries with the good intention of keeping the water clear of plankton and algae, allowing for healthier catfish.”2 Now the voracious and aggressive Asian carp have decimated native species. That well-known expression, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions,” is all too often true.

Kalman states, “We can’t assume that everything that results from our good intentions will be positive. . . . Good intentions alone are not enough to make our actions moral.” We have to take responsibility for the consequences of our actions, even if they’re unintended.

In <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 5">Galatians 5</a>, Paul provides us with a way of testing whether our actions are truly moral. If we’re acting in accordance with God’s will, everything we do will demonstrate the fruit of the Spirit, “love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control” (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 5:22, 23">Gal. 5:22, 23</a>, NIV). Just think how different history would be if world leaders had applied this test.

For Christian philosopher C. S. Lewis, the age-old argument about whether faith or works is more important is not really an argument at all. Both matter.

“Christians have often disputed as to whether what leads the Christian home is good actions, or Faith in Christ. . . . It does seem to me like asking which blade in a pair of scissors is most necessary.”3

`1. Have you ever done something that had unintended consequences?`

`2. Do terrorists think they have good intentions? Do you think they do?`

`3. Do the ends ever justify the means?`
