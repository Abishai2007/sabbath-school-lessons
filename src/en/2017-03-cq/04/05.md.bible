            'Gal 1:16; 2; 3:22; 5:22, 23': '<h3> <span>Galatians 1:16</span></h3><p> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood, </span> </p><h3> <span>Galatians 1:2</span></h3><p> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>and all the brethren who are with me,</span></p><p><span>To the churches of Galatia:</span></p><h3> <span>Galatians 3:22</span></h3><p> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. </span> </p><h3> <span>Galatians 5:22</span></h3><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, </span> </p><h3> <span>Galatians 5:23</span></h3><p> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. </span> </p>'
            'Rom 3:22–31': '<h3> <span>Romans 3:22-31</span></h3><p> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference; </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>whom God set forth <i>as</i> a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed, </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Where <i>is</i> boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Or <i>is He</i> the God of the Jews only? <i>Is He</i> not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also, </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>since <i>there is</i> one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law.</span></p>'
            'Luke 19:1–9': '<h3> <span>Luke 19:1-9</span></h3><p><span><span>19&#xA0;</span>Then <i>Jesus</i> entered and passed through Jericho. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Now behold, <i>there was</i> a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that <i>way.</i> </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, <span>&#x201C;Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at your house.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>So he made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>But when they saw <i>it,</i> they all complained, saying, &#x201C;He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, &#x201C;Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore fourfold.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>And Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham;</span> </span> </p>'
            'Galatians 2': '<h3> <span>Galatians 2</span></h3><p><span><span>2&#xA0;</span>Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and also took Titus with <i>me.</i> </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of reputation, lest by any means I might run, or had run, in vain. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Yet not even Titus who <i>was</i> with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And <i>this occurred</i> because of false brethren secretly brought in (who came in by stealth to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage), </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>to whom we did not yield submission even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>But from those who seemed to be something&#x2014;whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God shows personal favoritism to no man&#x2014;for those who seemed <i>to be something</i> added nothing to me. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel for the uncircumcised had been committed to me, as <i>the gospel</i> for the circumcised <i>was</i> to Peter </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>(for He who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised also worked effectively in me toward the Gentiles), </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that had been given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we <i>should go</i> to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup><i>They desired</i> only that we should remember the poor, the very thing which I also was eager to do.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed; </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>for before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before <i>them</i> all, &#x201C;If you, being a Jew, live in the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews, why do you compel Gentiles to live as Jews? </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>We <i>who are</i> Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, <i>is</i> Christ therefore a minister of sin? Certainly not! </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the <i>life</i> which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness <i>comes</i> through the law, then Christ died in vain.&#x201D;</span></p>'
            'John 8:3–11': '<h3> <span>John 8:3-11</span></h3><p> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>they said to Him, &#x201C;Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>This they said, testing Him, that they might have <i>something</i> of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with <i>His</i> finger, as though He did not hear.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, <span>&#x201C;He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then those who heard <i>it,</i> being convicted by <i>their</i> conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest <i>even</i> to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, <span>&#x201C;Woman, where are those accusers of yours?</span><span> Has no one condemned you?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>She said, &#x201C;No one, Lord.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>And Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Neither do I condemn you; go and</span> <span>sin no more.&#x201D;</span></span></p>'
            'James 2:18': '<h3> <span>James 2:18</span></h3><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But someone will say, &#x201C;You have faith, and I have works.&#x201D; Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. </span> </p>'
            'Gal 5:19': '<h3> <span>Galatians 5:19</span></h3><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, </span> </p>'

**How-to**: <a class="verse" verse="Luke 19:1–9">Luke 19:1–9</a>; <a class="verse" verse="John 8:3–11">John 8:3–11</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Rom 3:22–31">Rom. 3:22–31</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Gal 1:16; 2; 3:22; 5:22, 23">Gal. 1:16; 2; 3:22; 5:22, 23</a>; <a class="verse" verse="James 2:18">James 2:18</a>

The argument in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 2">Galatians 2</a> over circumcision is about being exclusive and about belonging to a distinctive community of the “saved” by obeying the law. Paul is “astonished” by such behavior (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 1:6">Gal. 1:6</a>, NIV), calling it a perversion of the gospel. So how can we make sure we avoid it?

Don’t use the law to judge others. Adventists are encouraged to live by certain guidelines about what to eat, what to wear, and how to behave. The guidelines are intended to keep us healthy and to protect us from what Paul calls the “acts of the flesh” (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 5:19">Gal. 5:19</a>, NIV). But it’s tempting to use them to judge others, turning them into sinners in the eyes of our community and creating barriers for new believers.

**None of us will be judged perfect because of how we’ve lived our lives, however obedient we were or however much good we did.**

Our tendency to judge one another, and our hypocrisy in doing so, is a constant theme in the Gospels.Remember the tax collector (<a class="verse" verse="Luke 19:1–9">Luke 19:1–9</a>) and the woman caught in adultery (<a class="verse" verse="John 8:3–11">John 8:3–11</a>), presented to Christ as sinners but forgiven by Him. Both of them and each of us are made right with God (“justified”) through faith—not by what we’ve done.

Reflect on the judgment and what saves us. Standing before God at the judgment, none of us will be judged perfect because of how we’ve lived our lives, however obedient we were or however much good we did. Instead, through grace (a free gift we do not deserve) Jesus will stand in our place. Although He is sinless, He suffered the punishment we deserve. Accepting this will keep our focus on faith rather than works. “This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe” (<a class="verse" verse="Rom 3:22">Rom. 3:22</a>, NIV).

Act in line with your faith. Your faith in Christ will show in your life—in your choices, your actions, and the way you treat other people (yes, they will notice). As James says, “Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds” (<a class="verse" verse="James 2:18">James 2:18</a>, NIV).

**React**

`1. Have you ever made judgments about whether someone else is a good Christian? Or have you heard others discuss church members in this way? Should they?`

`2. The world is very competitive.Some people strive for perfection and feel bad when they don’t achieve it.What does this week’s lesson say to them?`
