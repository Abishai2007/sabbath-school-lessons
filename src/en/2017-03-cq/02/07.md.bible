            '1 Thessalonians 2:1–12': '<h3> <span>1 Thessalonians 2:1-12</span></h3><p><span><span>2&#xA0;</span>For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was not in vain. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>But even after we had suffered before and were spitefully treated at Philippi, as you know, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much conflict. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For our exhortation <i>did</i> not <i>come</i> from error or uncleanness, nor <i>was it</i> in deceit.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>But as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who tests our hearts. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>For neither at any time did we use flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak for covetousness&#x2014;God <i>is</i> witness. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, when we might have made demands as apostles of Christ. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>But we were gentle among you, just as a nursing <i>mother</i> cherishes her own children. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>So, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>For you remember, brethren, our labor and toil; for laboring night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>You <i>are</i> witnesses, and God <i>also,</i> how devoutly and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you who believe; </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>as you know how we exhorted, and comforted, and charged every one of you, as a father <i>does</i> his own children, </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>that you would walk worthy of God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.</span></p>'
            'Galatians 1:10': '<h3> <span>Galatians 1:10</span></h3><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.</span></p>'
            'Galatians 1': '<h3> <span>Galatians 1</span></h3><p><span><span>1&#xA0;</span>Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead), </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>and all the brethren who are with me,</span></p><p><span>To the churches of Galatia:</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>to whom <i>be</i> glory forever and ever. Amen.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught <i>it,</i> but <i>it came</i> through the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and <i>tried to</i> destroy it. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother&#x2019;s womb and called <i>me</i> through His grace, </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood, </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those <i>who were</i> apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and remained with him fifteen days. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord&#x2019;s brother. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>(Now <i>concerning</i> the things which I write to you, indeed, before God, I do not lie.)</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Afterward I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which <i>were</i> in Christ. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>But they were hearing only, &#x201C;He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which he once <i>tried to</i> destroy.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And they glorified God in me.</span></p>'

**Exploration**: <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 1">Galatians 1</a>

**Conclude**

As this week’s lessons illustrate, Paul wrote this letter to make the Gentiles understand that his message wasn’t written by humans. God inspired the words and Paul spoke them. It wasn’t Paul’s message—it was God’s. We don’t have to ponder the lies people try to make us believe because we have God’s Word to compare those lies against. As <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 1:10">Galatians 1:10</a> says, God’s opinion is all that matters. We don’t need to please this world or believe it; we only need to please God—the one who made us and loves us regardless of who we are.

**Consider**

- Writing a poem about letting the distractions and lies of this world fade away until all that matters is God.
- Creating a collage of pictures representing the lies people feed you and then drawing a large red slash through it to remind you that God’s opinion of you should always be more important.
- Observing birds while you’re riding your bike, walking, or driving down the street. Ponder their uniqueness and the fact that no matter how strangely they act—they never change and God accepts them just like He accepts you.
- Starting a Bible study with some of your friends and looking at the lives of such people as Mary Magdalene, who allowed God’s opinion of her to overshadow anyone else’s.
- Turning <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 1:10">Galatians 1:10</a> into your daily prayer to remind you that God’s Word and His opinion is all that matters.
