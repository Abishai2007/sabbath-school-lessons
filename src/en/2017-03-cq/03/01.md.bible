            '1 Corinthians 12:12–31': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 12:12-31</span></h3><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also <i>is</i> Christ. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body&#x2014;whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free&#x2014;and have all been made to drink into one Spirit. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For in fact the body is not one member but many.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>If the foot should say, &#x201C;Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body,&#x201D; is it therefore not of the body? </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And if the ear should say, &#x201C;Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body,&#x201D; is it therefore not of the body? </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>If the whole body <i>were</i> an eye, where <i>would be</i> the hearing? If the whole <i>were</i> hearing, where <i>would be</i> the smelling? </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He pleased. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And if they were all one member, where <i>would</i> the body <i>be?</i></span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>But now indeed <i>there are</i> many members, yet one body. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And the eye cannot say to the hand, &#x201C;I have no need of you&#x201D;; nor again the head to the feet, &#x201C;I have no need of you.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And those <i>members</i> of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable <i>parts</i> have greater modesty, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>but our presentable <i>parts</i> have no need. But God composed the body, having given greater honor to that <i>part</i> which lacks it, </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>that there should be no schism in the body, but <i>that</i> the members should have the same care for one another. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with <i>it;</i> or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with <i>it.</i></span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup><i>Are</i> all apostles? <i>Are</i> all prophets? <i>Are</i> all teachers? <i>Are</i> all workers of miracles? </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>But earnestly desire the best gifts. And yet I show you a more excellent way.</span></p>'

Even though the gospel includes all people who accept it, there still is a line drawn in the sand that distinguishes the two natures.

**Introduction**:  <a class="verse" verse="Phil 2:2, 3">Phil. 2:2, 3</a>


**Unity in Diversity**

What does Christianity entail? Does it mean being superior or less of a sinner than other humans? How should Christians treat each other, and how do they become the salt of the earth? Paul in Galatians tackled all these questions. He focused on unity among the brethren because he realized that divisions were erupting and hierarchy issues were sprouting.This problem existed long before Paul’s time, and it continues to exist today. It was for this reason that Jesus said, in <a class="verse" verse="John 17:21">John 17:21</a>, “ ‘that all of them may be one’ ” (NIV).

**Together we can achieve more.**

Producing a delicious cake requires the baker to use ingredients such as cake flour, baking powder, raw eggs, sugar, and butter. Apart from the sugar, when each of these ingredients are tasted individually, they taste terrible. However, when each of these ingredients are mixed in the correct proportions and placed into a heated oven, they produce a delicious cake. Similarly, even though we are all different, we are all important in our own special way. Together we can achieve more.

Paul tells us in <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 12:12–31">1 Corinthians 12:12–31</a> that we are like different members of the body of Christ. The body performs at its peak when each part works harmoniously with the other parts to achieve a specific goal. Imagine the heart saying, “Today I am tired, so I refuse to pump any blood,” or the nervous system saying, “I need a break.” Would the body function? No, we would soon have a corpse.

Many clichés have been coined in an effort to promote unity, societies, and communities in order for the problem of division among humans to be reduced. If the world is determined to go an extra mile to promote oneness among nations, shouldn’t Christians be able to do an even better job? The desire of Christ is for unison among His people so that the work of the gospel can be spread throughout the world. However, caution needs to be taken to ensure that the principles of the gospel are not compromised in order to achieve the unity we strive to attain.

Remember, God has given to everyone work according to his/her ability. There are different kinds of work to be done, and workers of varied capabilities are needed. If our hearts are humble, if we have learned in the school of Christ to be meek and lowly, we may all press together in the narrow path marked out. No one is a misfit!
