Amen.<sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; <sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ&#x2019;s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy. <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed <i>are you,</i> for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified. <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people&#x2019;s matters. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>Yet if <i>anyone suffers</i> as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter.<sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>For the time <i>has come</i> for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if <i>it begins</i> with us first, what will <i>be</i> the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God? <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>Now<span class="oblique">&#x201C;If the righteous one is scarcely saved,</span><span class="oblique">Where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls <i>to Him</i> in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.'

**Conclude**

Paul’s concern for the Galatians’ welfare ran so deep that his tone became less theological and more nurturing. The theology was still present, but he encouraged them more. By changing his approach and sounding more like a pastor and less like a salesman, Paul actually gave the Galatians, and us for that matter, a chance to understand God in a more tangible way. For example, when he begged them to imitate him in the same way he imitated Christ (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:12;">Gal 4:12;</a> <a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 11:1">1 Cor. 11:1</a>), he proved God’s love for them was even stronger than his own and that God would stop at nothing to reach His people.

**Consider**

- Writing a poem about the difference encouragement has made in your life.
- Performing a skit based on Paul’s experience in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:12– 20 ">Galatians 4:12– 20 </a>with your friends at vespers or church to show others the power of a gentle ministry.
- Observing your pets, particularly dogs, cats, and horses, because these animals have a God-given ability to know when people need some encouraging comfort. You should learn from their kind of love and try to imitate it for someone else.
- Calling or visiting someone you haven’t seen at church in a while to see how they are doing and ask if you can encourage them in some way.
- Painting an encouraging phrase on your bedroom wall or drawing it on a piece of cardstock and hanging it in your room as a reminder that you should always imitate Jesus in whatever you do or say.
