            '2 Kings 4;': '<h3>2 Kings 4</h3><span class="chapternum">4&#xA0;</span>A certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, &#x201C;Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. And the creditor is coming to take my two sons to be his slaves.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>So Elisha said to her, &#x201C;What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?&#x201D; And she said, &#x201C;Your maidservant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Then he said, &#x201C;Go, borrow vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors&#x2014;empty vessels; do not gather just a few. <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>And when you have come in, you shall shut the door behind you and your sons; then pour it into all those vessels, and set aside the full ones.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons, who brought <i>the vessels</i> to her; and she poured <i>it</i> out. <sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>Now it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, &#x201C;Bring me another vessel.&#x201D;And he said to her, &#x201C;<i>There is</i> not another vessel.&#x201D; So the oil ceased. <sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, &#x201C;Go, sell the oil and pay your debt; and you <i>and</i> your sons live on the rest.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>Now it happened one day that Elisha went to Shunem, where there <i>was</i> a notable woman, and she persuaded him to eat some food. So it was, as often as he passed by, he would turn in there to eat some food. <sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>And she said to her husband, &#x201C;Look now, I know that this <i>is</i> a holy man of God, who passes by us regularly. <sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>Please, let us make a small upper room on the wall; and let us put a bed for him there, and a table and a chair and a lampstand; so it will be, whenever he comes to us, he can turn in there.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>And it happened one day that he came there, and he turned in to the upper room and lay down there. <sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>Then he said to Gehazi his servant, &#x201C;Call this Shunammite woman.&#x201D; When he had called her, she stood before him. <sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>And he said to him, &#x201C;Say now to her, &#x2018;Look, you have been concerned for us with all this care. What <i>can I</i> do for you? Do you want me to speak on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?&#x2019;&#x201D;She answered, &#x201C;I dwell among my own people.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>So he said, &#x201C;What then <i>is</i> to be done for her?&#x201D;And Gehazi answered, &#x201C;Actually, she has no son, and her husband is old.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>So he said, &#x201C;Call her.&#x201D; When he had called her, she stood in the doorway. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>Then he said, &#x201C;About this time next year you shall embrace a son.&#x201D;And she said, &#x201C;No, my lord. Man of God, do not lie to your maidservant!&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>But the woman conceived, and bore a son when the appointed time had come, of which Elisha had told her.<sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>And the child grew. Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers. <sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>And he said to his father, &#x201C;My head, my head!&#x201D;So he said to a servant, &#x201C;Carry him to his mother.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and <i>then</i> died. <sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut <i>the door</i> upon him, and went out. <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>Then she called to her husband, and said, &#x201C;Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>So he said, &#x201C;Why are you going to him today? <i>It is</i> neither the New Moon nor the Sabbath.&#x201D;And she said, &#x201C;<i>It is</i> well.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, &#x201C;Drive, and go forward; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>And so she departed, and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel.So it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, &#x201C;Look, the Shunammite woman! <sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>Please run now to meet her, and say to her, &#x2018;<i>Is it</i> well with you? <i>Is it</i> well with your husband? <i>Is it</i> well with the child?&#x2019;&#x201D;And she answered, &#x201C;<i>It is</i> well.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">27&#xA0;</sup>Now when she came to the man of God at the hill, she caught him by the feet, but Gehazi came near to push her away. But the man of God said, &#x201C;Let her alone; for her soul <i>is</i> in deep distress, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has hidden <i>it</i> from me, and has not told me.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">28&#xA0;</sup>So she said, &#x201C;Did I ask a son of my lord? Did I not say, &#x2018;Do not deceive me&#x2019;?&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">29&#xA0;</sup>Then he said to Gehazi, &#x201C;Get yourself ready, and take my staff in your hand, and be on your way. If you meet anyone, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not answer him; but lay my staff on the face of the child.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">30&#xA0;</sup>And the mother of the child said, &#x201C;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, and <i>as</i> your soul lives, I will not leave you.&#x201D; So he arose and followed her. <sup class="versenum">31&#xA0;</sup>Now Gehazi went on ahead of them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but <i>there was</i> neither voice nor hearing. Therefore he went back to meet him, and told him, saying, &#x201C;The child has not awakened.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">32&#xA0;</sup>When Elisha came into the house, there was the child, lying dead on his bed. <sup class="versenum">33&#xA0;</sup>He went in therefore, shut the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <sup class="versenum">34&#xA0;</sup>And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands; and he stretched himself out on the child, and the flesh of the child became warm. <sup class="versenum">35&#xA0;</sup>He returned and walked back and forth in the house, and again went up and stretched himself out on him; then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. <sup class="versenum">36&#xA0;</sup>And he called Gehazi and said, &#x201C;Call this Shunammite woman.&#x201D; So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, &#x201C;Pick up your son.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">37&#xA0;</sup>So she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground; then she picked up her son and went out.<sup class="versenum">38&#xA0;</sup>And Elisha returned to Gilgal, and <i>there was</i> a famine in the land. Now the sons of the prophets <i>were</i> sitting before him; and he said to his servant, &#x201C;Put on the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">39&#xA0;</sup>So one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and sliced <i>them</i> into the pot of stew, though they did not know <i>what they were.</i> <sup class="versenum">40&#xA0;</sup>Then they served it to the men to eat. Now it happened, as they were eating the stew, that they cried out and said, &#x201C;Man of God, <i>there is</i> death in the pot!&#x201D; And they could not eat <i>it.</i><sup class="versenum">41&#xA0;</sup>So he said, &#x201C;Then bring some flour.&#x201D; And he put <i>it</i> into the pot, and said, &#x201C;Serve <i>it</i> to the people, that they may eat.&#x201D; And there was nothing harmful in the pot.<sup class="versenum">42&#xA0;</sup>Then a man came from Baal Shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley bread, and newly ripened grain in his knapsack. And he said, &#x201C;Give <i>it</i> to the people, that they may eat.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">43&#xA0;</sup>But his servant said, &#x201C;What? Shall I set this before one hundred men?&#x201D;He said again, &#x201C;Give it to the people, that they may eat; for thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: &#x2018;They shall eat and have <i>some</i> left over.&#x2019;&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">44&#xA0;</sup>So he set <i>it</i> before them; and they ate and had <i>some</i> left over, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.'

**Logos**: <a class="verse" verse="2 Kings 4;">2 Kings 4;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Acts 26:28, 29;">Acts 26:28, 29;</a> <a class="verse" verse="2 Cor 5:17;">2 Cor. 5:17;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:12–20; 5:14">Gal. 4:12–20; 5:14</a>

**To Be Free** (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:19">Gal. 4:19</a>)

Paul’s letter to the churches of Galatia reproaches his fellow believers for forgetting God’s gospel and calls them to an obedience of truth and love rather than of Mosaic law. For the Pharisees, removing certain interpretations of Mosaic law and additional human-made, legal burdens from the position of prime authority over one’s life was often difficult to negotiate. As a result, many of these said individuals found themselves focused on salvation by works—or even worse, reverting back to their pagan lifestyles. Therefore, Paul labels himself a father of these disobedient Galatians, similar to God tending His disobedient children of Israel. As a mother enduring birthing pains, Paul urgently chastises his brothers, “until Christ be formed in [them]” (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:19">Gal 4:19</a>).

**To pursue righteousness by law means Jesus died in vain.**

Paul’s remedy for their demise is to have faith. Because Abraham believed, in him all nations were blessed and the sons of the freewoman Sarah’s son, Isaac, are of the covenant of the promise. Those born of the bondwoman’s son Ishmael are slaves to the law—of the covenant made with Moses at Mount Sinai (note the parallelism here). Yes, Mosaic law was provided from God, but it shouldn’t be followed without faith. The key is to have faith, and when one upholds that faith, one will be filled with the Spirit who will then guide one to follow the law out of love, not out of fear for salvation. Faith moves mountains.

After all, the Gentiles, says Paul, received spiritual circumcision, so to speak, by the Spirit and weren’t required to receive it physically, despite the law. Gentiles can be grafted into Christ as easily as a branch can snap off. So the question is, are we ready to be grafted, or are we on the brink of crashing down?

**Interpersonal Relations** (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:12–16">Gal. 4:12–16</a>)

While the bulk of Paul’s letter to the Galatians focuses on faith versus works, Paul also subtly focuses on his own concern for the relationship he has with them. “You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first. And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus” (verses 13, 14, NKJV). Earlier in chapter 1, Paul proclaims he preaches to please Christ, not man, and receives his ability to preach via Christ’s revelation upon him. Therefore, it’s important they not only hear but heed his message. They trusted him, even though he was ill. They received him wholeheartedly.

Now, because he’s in doubt of their faith in Christ, he rebukes them, but this seems to make them angry—perhaps embarrassed (verse 16). It’s not always fun to be wrong or give up things we covet, but the truth is what sets a soul free. It’s often through failure that we learn how to find a better path.

**God Is Love** (<a class="verse" verse="2 Kings 4;">2 Kings 4;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Acts 26:28, 29;">Acts 26:28, 29;</a> <a class="verse" verse="2 Cor 5:17;">2 Cor. 5:17;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Gal 5:14">Gal 5:14</a>)

When we have faith, we throw off our old selves and put on Christ. “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Cor 5:17, ">2 Cor. 5:17, </a>NKJV). In this new self, we are made righteous by our relationship with Christ, by our glorification of He who extended grace to us so we could be redeemed. But to pursue righteousness by law means Jesus died in vain. Therefore, brothers and sisters, let us remember in Christ we are one, and we all receive the same challenge: to spread that glorious Oil. “Then Agrippa said to Paul, ‘You almost persuade me to become a Christian.’ And Paul said, ‘I would to God that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might become both almost and altogether such as I am, except for these chains’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 26:28, 29, ">Acts 26:28, 29, </a>NKJV). Intense, right?

The law was intended to bring us to Christ until Christ could come to us. Now, we are called to have faith in that which we don’t see and to be filled with the Spirit. Only then can we be righteous by faith and be made stronger to endure the trials set before us. However, we are called to follow one aspect of the law at all times: “For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself” (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 5:14">Gal. 5:14</a>). We are called to be filled with the Spirit and then to pour forth the Spirit via the gospel into all the empty vessels until we run out of vessels to fill (<a class="verse" verse="2 Kings 4">2 Kings 4</a>). And who knows, we might be the vessels who need the filling.

`2. What phase matches me best: (a) filled with Oil, (b) filling vessels, (c) being filled, or (d) empty? Why?`
