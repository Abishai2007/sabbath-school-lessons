            '2 Cor 5:20; 10:2–6;': '<h3>2 Corinthians 5:20</h3><sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore <i>you</i> on Christ&#x2019;s behalf, be reconciled to God. <h3>2 Corinthians 10:2-6</h3><sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>But I beg you that when I am present I may not be bold with that confidence by which I intend to be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>For the weapons of our warfare <i>are</i> not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, <sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.'
            'Galatians 4:15, 16 ': '<h3>Galatians 4:15, 16</h3><sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>What then was the blessing you <i>enjoyed?</i> For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?'
            'Gal 4:15–18': '<h3>Galatians 4:15-18</h3><sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>What then was the blessing you <i>enjoyed?</i> For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?<sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>They zealously court you, <i>but</i> for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you.

**How-to**: <a class="verse" verse="2 Cor 5:20; 10:2–6;">2 Cor. 5:20; 10:2–6;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:15–18">Gal. 4:15–18</a>

Imagine a child constantly switching between two babysitters. There’s theperson wholistensto the parent’srulesandenforcesthem.Thenthere’s the person who lets the child do whatever the child wants—as long as the parents do not find out.

The younger child may think the latter babysitter cares about them more because of the freedom. However, parents make rules for a reason. They were not made for punishment. They were made for protection out of love. The first babysitter understands this and protects the child, hopefully out of that same love.

**We must allow God to work through us, or no work for Him will be done.**

We see Paul show the Galatians this same duty—to show the love of God. We are called to be like Paul and show others biblical truths. Even though they may appear to be harsh, we must make sure the receiver knows they’re being delivered with love, by love, and because of love. Second Corinthians 5:20 reminds us that we are the ambassadors for Christ and that we plead on His behalf. When we plead with people about a problem, it should not be for our benefit but theirs and, most of all, God’s.

We must allow God to work through us, or no work for Him will be done. How can we help people if we do not love them? If God is pushing you to go talk to someone about something that person might be doing wrong, then talk to them like Jesus would. Approach them with love and kindness and be there with them through the struggle of sin.

It won’t always work, and some people will not be ready, but your job is to give them the opportunity. <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4:15, 16 ">Galatians 4:15, 16 </a>shows us Paul addressing how the Galatians might have done anything for him in the past, but now they treat him like a stranger because he’s trying to correct their errors. Just because you approach someone with the love of Jesus does not mean they will be ready for it. Be like Jesus. Give them time, and give them love.

`1. Why do you think being honest with biblical truths and godly love can go hand in hand?`

`2. What are some ways you can help correct errors while showing the love behind the corrections?`
