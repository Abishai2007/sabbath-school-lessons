Stay here and watch with Me.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">39&#xA0;</sup>He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, <span class="woj">&#x201C;O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You <i>will.</i>&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">40&#xA0;</sup>Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, <span class="woj">&#x201C;What! Could you not watch with Me one hour?</span> <sup class="versenum">41&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed <i>is</i> willing, but the flesh <i>is</i> weak.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">42&#xA0;</sup>Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, <span class="woj">&#x201C;O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless</span><span class="woj"> I drink it, Your will be done.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">43&#xA0;</sup>And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.<sup class="versenum">44&#xA0;</sup>So He left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. <sup class="versenum">45&#xA0;</sup>Then He came to His disciples and said to them, <span class="woj">&#x201C;Are <i>you</i> still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <sup class="versenum">46&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">Rise, let us be going. See, My betrayer is at hand.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">47&#xA0;</sup>And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and elders of the people.<sup class="versenum">48&#xA0;</sup>Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying, &#x201C;Whomever I kiss, He is the One; seize Him.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">49&#xA0;</sup>Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, &#x201C;Greetings, Rabbi!&#x201D; and kissed Him.<sup class="versenum">50&#xA0;</sup>But Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#x201C;Friend, why have you come?&#x201D;</span>Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him. <sup class="versenum">51&#xA0;</sup>And suddenly, one of those <i>who were</i> with Jesus stretched out <i>his</i> hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.<sup class="versenum">52&#xA0;</sup>But Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#x201C;Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish</span><span class="woj"> by the sword.</span> <sup class="versenum">53&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">Or do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <sup class="versenum">54&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">How then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">55&#xA0;</sup>In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, <span class="woj">&#x201C;Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take Me? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me.</span> <sup class="versenum">56&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">But all this was done that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.&#x201D;</span>Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.<sup class="versenum">57&#xA0;</sup>And those who had laid hold of Jesus led <i>Him</i> away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. <sup class="versenum">58&#xA0;</sup>But Peter followed Him at a distance to the high priest&#x2019;s courtyard. And he went in and sat with the servants to see the end.<sup class="versenum">59&#xA0;</sup>Now the chief priests, the elders, and all the council sought false testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, <sup class="versenum">60&#xA0;</sup>but found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward <sup class="versenum">61&#xA0;</sup>and said, &#x201C;This <i>fellow</i> said, &#x2018;I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">62&#xA0;</sup>And the high priest arose and said to Him, &#x201C;Do You answer nothing? What <i>is it</i> these men testify against You?&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">63&#xA0;</sup>But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, &#x201C;I put You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">64&#xA0;</sup>Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#x201C;<i>It is as</i> you said. Nevertheless, I say to you, hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">65&#xA0;</sup>Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, &#x201C;He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? Look, now you have heard His blasphemy! <sup class="versenum">66&#xA0;</sup>What do you think?&#x201D;They answered and said, &#x201C;He is deserving of death.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">67&#xA0;</sup>Then they spat in His face and beat Him; and others struck <i>Him</i> with the palms of their hands, <sup class="versenum">68&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x201C;Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who struck You?&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">69&#xA0;</sup>Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him, saying, &#x201C;You also were with Jesus of Galilee.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">70&#xA0;</sup>But he denied it before <i>them</i> all, saying, &#x201C;I do not know what you are saying.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">71&#xA0;</sup>And when he had gone out to the gateway, another <i>girl</i> saw him and said to those <i>who were</i> there, &#x201C;This <i>fellow</i> also was with Jesus of Nazareth.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">72&#xA0;</sup>But again he denied with an oath, &#x201C;I do not know the Man!&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">73&#xA0;</sup>And a little later those who stood by came up and said to Peter, &#x201C;Surely you also are <i>one</i> of them, for your speech betrays you.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">74&#xA0;</sup>Then he began to curse and swear, <i>saying,</i> &#x201C;I do not know the Man!&#x201D;Immediately a rooster crowed. <sup class="versenum">75&#xA0;</sup>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus who had said to him, <span class="woj">&#x201C;Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.&#x201D;</span> So he went out and wept bitterly.'

**Introduction**: <a class="verse" verse="Matt 22:34–40;">Matt. 22:34–40;</a> <a class="verse" verse="John 13:34">John 13:34</a>

**Perfect or Real?**

_Perfect: “Entirely without any flaws, defects, or shortcomings.”1_

_Real: “Actual rather than imaginary, ideal, or fictitious.”2_

Why start off with definitions of these two words? Interestingly, although they are not antonyms, it is literally impossible to be both at the same time.The bottom line is that nothing is perfect in reality, nor is anything real perfect; yet one thing contradicts this philosophy—God.

**I am thankful that I am loved unconditionally by Jesus.**

Humans, who were created in the image of God, are obviously imperfect. In <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 26, ">Matthew 26, </a>Peter denied Jesus three times, and yet it was Peter who was given the grand mission of growing, developing, and leading the early Christian church. Even Jesus, who was perfect, was persecuted for the radical message that seemed to rub hard against traditional Jewish teaching.What was so radical about this message? Does Jesus want us to live imperfect lives knowing we are slaves to sin? Or does He demand perfection in a world where that is impossible? Neither is correct.

Although God knows we are not perfect, He gives us the freedom to make choices regarding the way we relate to each other and then gives us divine counsel as to the best choices we can possibly make.Trying to be perfect and striving toward perfection under God are very different things. Jesus calls us to strive toward a Christlike perfection: “ ‘A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="John 13:34, ">John 13:34, </a>NIV). The human endeavor for perfection is one of loving. God has created us naturally to enjoy caring for one another. I am thankful that I am loved unconditionally by Jesus. Being loved is the best feeling in the world, and to love someone else is just as pleasing.

When challenged by the Pharisees to select the most important of all commandments, Jesus answered, “ ‘ “Love the Lord your God.” . . .“Love your neighbor as yourself.” All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt22:37–40, ">Matt.22:37–40, </a>NIV).As you study the themes of this week’s lesson, first ask yourself with each lesson, how can this concept help me to better know and love God? Second, ask how what you have studied can be applied to the human relationships in your life.
