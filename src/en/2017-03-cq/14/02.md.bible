            'Luke 24:44, 45': '<h3>Luke 24:44, 45</h3><sup class="versenum">44&#xA0;</sup>Then He said to them, <span class="woj">&#x201C;These <i>are</i> the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and <i>the</i> Prophets and <i>the</i> Psalms concerning Me.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">45&#xA0;</sup>And He opened their understanding, that they might comprehend the Scriptures.'
            'Heb 4:14, 16;': '<h3>Hebrews 4:14, 16</h3><sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i>our</i> confession. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.'
            'Numbers 7–10;': '<h3>Numbers 7-10</h3><span class="chapternum">10&#xA0;</span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying: <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Make two silver trumpets for yourself; you shall make them of hammered work; you shall use them for calling the congregation and for directing the movement of the camps. <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>When they blow both of them, all the congregation shall gather before you at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>But if they blow <i>only</i> one, then the leaders, the heads of the divisions of Israel, shall gather to you. <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>When you sound the advance, the camps that lie on the east side shall then begin their journey. <sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>When you sound the advance the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall begin their journey; they shall sound the call for them to begin their journeys. <sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>And when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but not sound the advance. <sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and these shall be to you as an ordinance forever throughout your generations.<sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;When you go to war in your land against the enemy who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, and you will be remembered before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, and you will be saved from your enemies. <sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>Also in the day of your gladness, in your appointed feasts, and at the beginning of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be a memorial for you before your God: I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>Now it came to pass on the twentieth <i>day</i> of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from above the tabernacle of the Testimony. <sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>And the children of Israel set out from the Wilderness of Sinai on their journeys; then the cloud settled down in the Wilderness of Paran. <sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>So they started out for the first time according to the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> by the hand of Moses.<sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>The standard of the camp of the children of Judah set out first according to their armies; over their army was Nahshon the son of Amminadab. <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>Over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar <i>was</i> Nethanel the son of Zuar. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>And over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun <i>was</i> Eliab the son of Helon.<sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>Then the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set out, carrying the tabernacle.<sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>And the standard of the camp of Reuben set out according to their armies; over their army <i>was</i> Elizur the son of Shedeur. <sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>Over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon <i>was</i> Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>And over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad <i>was</i> Eliasaph the son of Deuel.<sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things.

            'Acts 13:13–43': '<h3>Acts 13:13-43</h3><sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>Now when Paul and his party set sail from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia; and John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down. <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, &#x201C;Men <i>and</i> brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>Then Paul stood up, and motioning with <i>his</i> hand said, &#x201C;Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen: <sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He brought them out of it. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>Now for a time of about forty years He put up with their ways in the wilderness. <sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>And when He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land to them by allotment.<sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;After that He gave <i>them</i> judges for about four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet. <sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>And afterward they asked for a king; so God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>And when He had removed him, He raised up for them David as king, to whom also He gave testimony and said, <span class="oblique">&#x2018;I have found David</span> the <i>son</i> of Jesse, <span class="oblique">a man after My</span> <i>own</i> <span class="oblique">heart,</span> who will do all My will.&#x2019; <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>From this man&#x2019;s seed, according to <i>the</i> promise, God raised up for Israel a Savior&#x2014;Jesus&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>after John had first preached, before His coming, the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>And as John was finishing his course, he said, &#x2018;Who do you think I am? I am not <i>He.</i> But behold, there comes One after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.&#x2019;<sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Men <i>and</i> brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you the word of this salvation has been sent. <sup class="versenum">27&#xA0;</sup>For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they did not know Him, nor even the voices of the Prophets which are read every Sabbath, have fulfilled <i>them</i> in condemning <i>Him.</i> <sup class="versenum">28&#xA0;</sup>And though they found no cause for death <i>in Him,</i> they asked Pilate that He should be put to death. <sup class="versenum">29&#xA0;</sup>Now when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him, they took <i>Him</i> down from the tree and laid <i>Him</i> in a tomb. <sup class="versenum">30&#xA0;</sup>But God raised Him from the dead. <sup class="versenum">31&#xA0;</sup>He was seen for many days by those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses to the people. <sup class="versenum">32&#xA0;</sup>And we declare to you glad tidings&#x2014;that promise which was made to the fathers. <sup class="versenum">33&#xA0;</sup>God has fulfilled this for us their children, in that He has raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second Psalm:<span class="oblique">&#x2018;You are My Son,</span><span class="oblique">Today I have begotten You.&#x2019;</span><sup class="versenum">34&#xA0;</sup>And that He raised Him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, He has spoken thus:<span class="oblique">&#x2018;I will give you the sure mercies of David.&#x2019;</span><sup class="versenum">35&#xA0;</sup>Therefore He also says in another <i>Psalm:</i><span class="oblique">&#x2018;You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.&#x2019;</span><sup class="versenum">36&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep, was buried with his fathers, and saw corruption; <sup class="versenum">37&#xA0;</sup>but He whom God raised up saw no corruption. <sup class="versenum">38&#xA0;</sup>Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through this Man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins; <sup class="versenum">39&#xA0;</sup>and by Him everyone who believes is justified from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses. <sup class="versenum">40&#xA0;</sup>Beware therefore, lest what has been spoken in the prophets come upon you:<sup class="versenum">41&#xA0;</sup><span class="oblique">&#x2018;Behold, you despisers,</span><span class="oblique">Marvel and perish!</span><span class="oblique">For I work a work in your days,</span><span class="oblique">A work which you will by no means believe,</span><span class="oblique">Though one were to declare it to you.&#x2019;</span>&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">42&#xA0;</sup>So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath. <sup class="versenum">43&#xA0;</sup>Now when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.'
            'Gal 3:24–27': '<h3>Galatians 3:24-27</h3><sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the law was our tutor <i>to bring us</i> to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.<sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. <sup class="versenum">27&#xA0;</sup>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. '
            '1 Cor 6:19': '<h3>1 Corinthians 6:19</h3><sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit <i>who is</i> in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? '
            'John 2:21;': '<h3>John 2:21</h3><sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>But He was speaking of the temple of His body. '
            'Gal 4:3–7': '<h3>Galatians 4:3-7</h3><sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world. <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.<sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, &#x201C;Abba, Father!&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.'
            'Hebrews 9': '<h3>Hebrews 9</h3><span class="chapternum">9&#xA0;</span>Then indeed, even the first <i>covenant</i> had ordinances of divine service and the earthly sanctuary. <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>For a tabernacle was prepared: the first <i>part,</i> in which <i>was</i> the lampstand, the table, and the showbread, which is called the sanctuary; <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>and behind the second veil, the part of the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of All, <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which <i>were</i> the golden pot that had the manna, Aaron&#x2019;s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant; <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.<sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>Now when these things had been thus prepared, the priests always went into the first part of the tabernacle, performing the services. <sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>But into the second part the high priest <i>went</i> alone once a year, not without blood, which he offered for himself and <i>for</i> the people&#x2019;s sins <i>committed</i> in ignorance; <sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>the Holy Spirit indicating this, that the way into the Holiest of All was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing. <sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>It <i>was</i> symbolic for the present time in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make him who performed the service perfect in regard to the conscience&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup><i>concerned</i> only with foods and drinks, various washings, and fleshly ordinances imposed until the time of reformation.<sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>But Christ came <i>as</i> High Priest of the good things to come, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation. <sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption. <sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies for the purifying of the flesh, <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>And for this reason He is the Mediator of the new covenant, by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, that those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.<sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>For where there <i>is</i> a testament, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. <sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>For a testament <i>is</i> in force after men are dead, since it has no power at all while the testator lives. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>Therefore not even the first <i>covenant</i> was dedicated without blood. <sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>saying, <span class="oblique">&#x201C;This</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>Then likewise he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry. <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.<sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>Therefore <i>it was</i> necessary that the copies of the things in the heavens should be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>For Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, <i>which are</i> copies of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us; <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>not that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood of another&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>He then would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now, once at the end of the ages, He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. <sup class="versenum">27&#xA0;</sup>And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment, <sup class="versenum">28&#xA0;</sup>so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation.'
            'Heb8:10': '<h3>Hebrews 8:10</h3><sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup><span class="oblique">For this</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</span> '
            'Acts 9': '<h3>Acts 9</h3><span class="chapternum">9&#xA0;</span>Then Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>and asked letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.<sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>As he journeyed he came near Damascus, and suddenly a light shone around him from heaven. <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>Then he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, <span class="woj">&#x201C;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>And he said, &#x201C;Who are You, Lord?&#x201D;Then the Lord said, <span class="woj">&#x201C;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</span> <span class="woj">It <i>is</i> hard for you to kick against the goads.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>So he, trembling and astonished, said, &#x201C;Lord, what do You want me to do?&#x201D;Then the Lord <i>said</i> to him, <span class="woj">&#x201C;Arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice but seeing no one. <sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>Then Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened he saw no one. But they led him by the hand and brought <i>him</i> into Damascus. <sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.<sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and to him the Lord said in a vision, <span class="woj">&#x201C;Ananias.&#x201D;</span>And he said, &#x201C;Here I am, Lord.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>So the Lord <i>said</i> to him, <span class="woj">&#x201C;Arise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for <i>one</i> called Saul of Tarsus, for behold, he is praying.</span> <sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">And in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and putting <i>his</i> hand on him, so that he might receive his sight.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>Then Ananias answered, &#x201C;Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your name.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>But the Lord said to him, <span class="woj">&#x201C;Go, for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel.</span> <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">For I will show him how many things he must suffer for My name&#x2019;s sake.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and laying his hands on him he said, &#x201C;Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>Immediately there fell from his eyes <i>something</i> like scales, and he received his sight at once; and he arose and was baptized.<sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>So when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then Saul spent some days with the disciples at Damascus.<sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>Immediately he preached the Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.<sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>Then all who heard were amazed, and said, &#x201C;Is this not he who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and has come here for that purpose, so that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this <i>Jesus</i> is the Christ.<sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>Now after many days were past, the Jews plotted to kill him. <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>But their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night, to kill him. <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>Then the disciples took him by night and let <i>him</i> down through the wall in a large basket.<sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>And when Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, and did not believe that he was a disciple. <sup class="versenum">27&#xA0;</sup>But Barnabas took him and brought <i>him</i> to the apostles. And he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. <sup class="versenum">28&#xA0;</sup>So he was with them at Jerusalem, coming in and going out. <sup class="versenum">29&#xA0;</sup>And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the Hellenists, but they attempted to kill him. <sup class="versenum">30&#xA0;</sup>When the brethren found out, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him out to Tarsus.<sup class="versenum">31&#xA0;</sup>Then the churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and were edified. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.<sup class="versenum">32&#xA0;</sup>Now it came to pass, as Peter went through all <i>parts of the country,</i> that he also came down to the saints who dwelt in Lydda. <sup class="versenum">33&#xA0;</sup>There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years and was paralyzed. <sup class="versenum">34&#xA0;</sup>And Peter said to him, &#x201C;Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals you. Arise and make your bed.&#x201D; Then he arose immediately. <sup class="versenum">35&#xA0;</sup>So all who dwelt at Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.<sup class="versenum">36&#xA0;</sup>At Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and charitable deeds which she did. <sup class="versenum">37&#xA0;</sup>But it happened in those days that she became sick and died. When they had washed her, they laid <i>her</i> in an upper room. <sup class="versenum">38&#xA0;</sup>And since Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him, imploring <i>him</i> not to delay in coming to them. <sup class="versenum">39&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter arose and went with them. When he had come, they brought <i>him</i> to the upper room. And all the widows stood by him weeping, showing the tunics and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them. <sup class="versenum">40&#xA0;</sup>But Peter put them all out, and knelt down and prayed. And turning to the body he said, &#x201C;Tabitha, arise.&#x201D; And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up. <sup class="versenum">41&#xA0;</sup>Then he gave her <i>his</i> hand and lifted her up; and when he had called the saints and widows, he presented her alive. <sup class="versenum">42&#xA0;</sup>And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord. <sup class="versenum">43&#xA0;</sup>So it was that he stayed many days in Joppa with Simon, a tanner.'

The establishment of the first Gentile Christian church in Galatia was plagued with much persecution from the Jews. They opposed this “new gospel” that was being taught by the disciples. In spite of this, Paul and Barnabas journeyed throughout Galatia. On the Sabbath, they went into the synagogue, and Paul stood up and opened the Galatians’ understanding of the Scriptures (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 13:13–43">Acts 13:13–43</a>), as Jesus did for him and the other disciples after His resurrection (<a class="verse" verse="Luke 24:44, 45">Luke 24:44, 45</a>;<a class="verse" verse="Acts 9">Acts 9</a>).As a result, the Gentile congregation grew.

**Jesus wants to be one with us, as He is one**

with the Father, to restore us to our royal heritage.

Paul’s gospel was Jesus’ message. God used the Old Testament traditions and ceremonies like “apps”—the more you download, use, and follow—the more you master its uses and welcome its upgrades. Yet, the Jews refused Jesus’ latest system update, which stripped them of their corporate job titles. They could not understand the application of our bodies becoming God’s temple and dwelling place (<a class="verse" verse="John 2:21;">John 2:21;</a> <a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 6:19">1 Cor. 6:19</a>), as well as all the sanctuary ceremonies only involving God and each person individually (<a class="verse" verse="Numbers 7–10;">Numbers 7–10;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Heb 4:14, 16;">Heb. 4:14, 16;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Hebrews 9">Hebrews 9</a>).

There was no longer a need for a human intercessor or priest. Notice, Jesus did not change any inherent meaning of the sanctuary symbols. He just expressed their true application. He opened our understanding to the primary message He had been communicating all along. Jesus wants to be one with us, as He is one with the Father, to restore us to our royal heritage (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:3–7">Gal. 4:3–7</a>).

At Mount Sinai, God wrote one law (kept in the Most Holy Place) with His own finger and orated the other for Moses to pen. Both laws emphasized how to worship God and care for others. One law was a daily and annual coaching tool that explained why you live out the other by faith (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 3:24–27">Gal. 3:24–27</a>). “ ‘The righteous will live by faith’ ” (verse 11, NIV) only when God writes His law upon the tables of our hearts and minds (see <a class="verse" verse="Heb8:10">Heb.8:10</a>).This is the new Most Holy Place where God dwells.
