        verses:
            'Rom 6:14, 15;': '<h3>Romans 6:14, 15</h3><sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace.<sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not! '
            'Gal 3:23, 24': '<h3>Galatians 3:23, 24</h3><sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the law was our tutor <i>to bring us</i> to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. '
            'Romans 7;': '<h3>Romans 7</h3><span class="chapternum">7&#xA0;</span>Or do you not know, brethren (for I speak to those who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives? <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>For the woman who has a husband is bound by the law to <i>her</i> husband as long as he lives. But if the husband dies, she is released from the law of <i>her</i> husband. <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>So then if, while <i>her</i> husband lives, she marries another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she has married another man. <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another&#x2014;to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should bear fruit to God. <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit to death. <sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>But now we have been delivered from the law, having died to what we were held by, so that we should serve in the newness of the Spirit and not <i>in</i> the oldness of the letter.<sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>What shall we say then? <i>Is</i> the law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, <span class="oblique">&#x201C;You shall not covet.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>But sin, taking opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all <i>manner of evil</i> desire. For apart from the law sin <i>was</i> dead. <sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>I was alive once without the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died. <sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>And the commandment, which <i>was</i> to <i>bring</i> life, I found to <i>bring</i> death. <sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed <i>me.</i> <sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the law <i>is</i> holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.<sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>Has then what is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful. <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin. <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>For what I am doing, I do not understand. For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate, that I do. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>If, then, I do what I will not to do, I agree with the law that <i>it is</i> good. <sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>But now, <i>it is</i> no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but <i>how</i> to perform what is good I do not find. <sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>For the good that I will <i>to do,</i> I do not do; but the evil I will not <i>to do,</i> that I practice. <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>Now if I do what I will not <i>to do,</i> it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.<sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good. <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>I thank God&#x2014;through Jesus Christ our Lord!So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.'

“The English word slave comes from the Old French sclave, from the Medieval Latin sclavus,from the Byzantine Greek , which, in turn, comes from the ethnonym Slav.”1

Many cultures in history have gone through periods of slavery. One example is the Hebrew nation, whose story we know from the Bible. Another is the history of slavery in America, which became legal in 1641. However, in “September 1862, Lincoln issued a preliminary emancipation proclamation, and on January 1, 1863, he made it official that ‘slaves within any State, or designated part of a State . . . in rebellion, . . . shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.’ ”2

**The bottom line is that living without God makes us slaves to this world, sin, and Satan.**

Satan uses various methods to enslave us. From the beginning, he deceived the third part of the angels. He did the same with Adam and Eve, thus making us his slaves. His deceiving methods have changed over time, but his goal remains the same.

Have you noticed how today we have so many “time-saving inventions,” yet we don’t have time for anything? We’ve become modern slaves. The enemy has convinced us that God’s law is boring. Instead he offers us the illusion of freedom and the idea that we can do whatever we want.However, we become slaves to our jobs, forced to comply with their standards just to get a few dollars and buy stuff we think will make us happy.The list could go on, but the bottom line is that living without God makes us slaves to this world, sin, and Satan.

God’s law, on the other hand, offers us freedom.When we take a closer look at the Ten Commandments, we see they exist for us to have a better life, not to stop us from enjoying it.

It’s like when your parents tell you not to touch the iron. They are just preventing you from getting burned.Similarly God gave us free will.Everything we do has a consequence, and because He is our Father, He is trying to prevent us from getting burned.
