            'Mark 10:17–22;': '<h3>Mark 10:17-22</h3><sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>Now as He was going out on the road, one came running, knelt before Him, and asked Him, &#x201C;Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>So Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#x201C;Why do you call Me good? No one <i>is</i> good but One, <i>that is,</i> God.</span> <sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">You know the commandments: &#x2018;Do not commit adultery,&#x2019; &#x2018;Do not murder,&#x2019; &#x2018;Do not steal,&#x2019; &#x2018;Do not bear false witness,&#x2019; &#x2018;Do not defraud,&#x2019; &#x2018;Honor your father and your mother.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>And he answered and said to Him, &#x201C;Teacher, all these things I have kept from my youth.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, <span class="woj">&#x201C;One thing you lack: Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow Me.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>But he was sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.'
            'Galatians 3;': '<h3>Galatians 3</h3><span class="chapternum">3&#xA0;</span>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified? <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh? <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>Have you suffered so many things in vain&#x2014;if indeed <i>it was</i> in vain?<sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, <i>does He do it</i> by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>just as Abraham <span class="oblique">&#x201C;believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore know that <i>only</i> those who are of faith are sons of Abraham. <sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, <i>saying,</i> <span class="oblique">&#x201C;In you all the nations shall be blessed.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>So then those who <i>are</i> of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.<sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, <span class="oblique">&#x201C;Cursed</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God <i>is</i> evident, for <span class="oblique">&#x201C;the just shall live by faith.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>Yet the law is not of faith, but <span class="oblique">&#x201C;the man who does them shall live by them.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, <span class="oblique">&#x201C;Cursed</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">everyone who hangs on a tree&#x201D;</span>),<sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.<sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though <i>it is</i> only a man&#x2019;s covenant, yet <i>if it is</i> confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, &#x201C;And to seeds,&#x201D; as of many, but as of one, <span class="oblique">&#x201C;And to your Seed,&#x201D;</span> who is Christ. <sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>And this I say, <i>that</i> the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>For if the inheritance <i>is</i> of the law, <i>it is</i> no longer of promise; but God gave <i>it</i> to Abraham by promise.<sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>What purpose then <i>does</i> the law <i>serve?</i> It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; <i>and it was</i> appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator. <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>Now a mediator does not <i>mediate</i> for one <i>only,</i> but God is one.<sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup><i>Is</i> the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the law was our tutor <i>to bring us</i> to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.<sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. <sup class="versenum">27&#xA0;</sup>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. <sup class="versenum">28&#xA0;</sup>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <sup class="versenum">29&#xA0;</sup>And if you <i>are</i> Christ&#x2019;s, then you are Abraham&#x2019;s seed, and heirs according to the promise.'
            'Mark 10:22, ': '<h3>Mark 10:22</h3><sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>But he was sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.'
            'Romans 4;': '<h3>Romans 4</h3><span class="chapternum">4&#xA0;</span>What then shall we say that Abraham our father has found according to the flesh? <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>For if Abraham was justified by works, he has <i>something</i> to boast about, but not before God. <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>For what does the Scripture say? <span class="oblique">&#x201C;Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>Now to him who works, the wages are not counted as grace but as debt.<sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness, <sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>just as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from works:<sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup><span class="oblique">&#x201C;Blessed <i>are those</i> whose lawless deeds are forgiven,</span><span class="oblique">And whose sins are covered;</span><sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup><span class="oblique">Blessed</span> <i>is the</i> <span class="oblique">man to whom the L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">ord</span><span class="oblique"> shall not impute sin.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup><i>Does</i> this blessedness then <i>come</i> upon the circumcised <i>only,</i> or upon the uncircumcised also?

Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised. <sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which <i>he had while still</i> uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they are uncircumcised, that righteousness might be imputed to them also, <sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>and the father of circumcision to those who not only <i>are</i> of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of the faith which our father Abraham <i>had while still</i> uncircumcised.<sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>For the promise that he would be the heir of the world <i>was</i> not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>For if those who are of the law <i>are</i> heirs, faith is made void and the promise made of no effect, <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>because the law brings about wrath; for where there is no law <i>there is</i> no transgression.<sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>Therefore <i>it is</i> of faith that <i>it might be</i> according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all <sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>(as it is written, <span class="oblique">&#x201C;I have made you a father of many nations&#x201D;</span>) in the presence of Him whom he believed&#x2014;God, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did; <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>who, contrary to hope, in hope believed, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was spoken, <span class="oblique">&#x201C;So shall your descendants be.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already dead (since he was about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah&#x2019;s womb. <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, <sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform. <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>And therefore <span class="oblique">&#x201C;it was accounted to him for righteousness.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him, <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>but also for us. It shall be imputed to us who believe in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>who was delivered up because of our offenses, and was raised because of our justification.'

_It’s not personal, it’s just business._

This line is often used to placate a person who has just found themselves on the losing end of a deal.To avoid these personal conflicts and minimize risk, often lengthy legal documents are drawn up and signed.The fine print details the consequences of any breach.The contract binds the parties together.

**The bedrock of his existence was his close, personal relationship with God.**

Is a contract the same as a promise? Think about the people who promise to spend quality time with you, help, or pray for you.You don’t need a written contract for the promises that come with these personal relationships. That’s why when a romance ends, it is so painful.What made that relationship meaningful and unique was the building up of trust over time.

In Galatians, Paul’s indignation is directed at those attempting to fetter the free hearts of new Christians with the heavy chains of an ironclad contract. Their creed was that in rigidly obeying the law, they would earn eternal life. Paul passionately reminds them that the promise to Abraham and the gospel of Jesus are paramount.

What was Abraham’s part? He believed God without needing any worldly evidence. Abraham, by faith, stepped into the story that God had written for him. Thus, he physically and spiritually began a lifelong trek into the desert without any knowledge of where he was going (<a class="verse" verse="Heb11:8">Heb.11:8</a>).The bedrock of his existence was his close, personal relationship with God.

Mark tells the story of the rich, young ruler who approached Jesus and asked what he must do to gain eternal life. He had kept all the commandments since his birth. What was Jesus’ response? First, Jesus looked into his heart and loved him. Then He asked him to give up all of his possessions in exchange for becoming a disciple; for entering into the beautiful, blind faith of following the Son of God into the unknown. The Bible says, “He went away sad, because he had great wealth” (<a class="verse" verse="Mark 10:22, ">Mark 10:22, </a>NIV). He wanted the tangible contract, not the risk that accompanied a leap of faith.

Sadly, for him it wasn’t personal, it was just business.

`1. In your experience in the church, do you feel most of the emphasis is placed on salvation by faith or by works?`

`2. In your life, do you find yourself motivated by what God might provide for you—that new job, for example—rather than focusing on His promise to you?`
