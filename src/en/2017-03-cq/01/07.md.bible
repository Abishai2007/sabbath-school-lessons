            'Acts 15:1–5': '<h3> <span>Acts 15:1-5</span></h3><p><span><span>15&#xA0;</span>And certain <i>men</i> came down from Judea and taught the brethren, &#x201C;Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, about this question.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brethren. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders; and they reported all things that God had done with them. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, &#x201C;It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command <i>them</i> to keep the law of Moses.&#x201D;</span></p>'
            'Acts 11:18': '<h3> <span>Acts 11:18</span></h3><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>When they heard these things they became silent; and they glorified God, saying, &#x201C;Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life.&#x201D;</span></p>'

            'Acts 7': '<h3> <span>Acts 7</span></h3><p><span><span>7&#xA0;</span>Then the high priest said, &#x201C;Are these things so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And he said, &#x201C;Brethren and fathers, listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>and said to him, <span>&#x2018;Get out of your country and from your relatives, and come to a land that I will show you.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Then he came out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran. And from there, when his father was dead, He moved him to this land in which you now dwell. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And <i>God</i> gave him no inheritance in it, not even <i>enough</i> to set his foot on. But even when <i>Abraham</i> had no child, He promised to give it to him for a possession, and to his descendants after him. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>But God spoke in this way: that his descendants would dwell in a foreign land, and that they would bring them into bondage and oppress <i>them</i> four hundred years. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x2018;And the nation to whom they will be in bondage I will judge,&#x2019;</span> said God, <span>&#x2018;and after that they shall come out and serve Me in this place.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so <i>Abraham</i> begot Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac <i>begot</i> Jacob, and Jacob <i>begot</i> the twelve patriarchs.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;And the patriarchs, becoming envious, sold Joseph into Egypt. But God was with him </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>and delivered him out of all his troubles, and gave him favor and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Now a famine and great trouble came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and our fathers found no sustenance. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And the second <i>time</i> Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph&#x2019;s family became known to the Pharaoh. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob and all his relatives to <i>him,</i> seventy-five people. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>So Jacob went down to Egypt; and he died, he and our fathers. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor, <i>the father</i> of Shechem.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;But when the time of the promise drew near which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>till another king arose who did not know Joseph. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>This man dealt treacherously with our people, and oppressed our forefathers, making them expose their babies, so that they might not live. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>At this time Moses was born, and was well pleasing to God; and he was brought up in his father&#x2019;s house for three months. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>But when he was set out, Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter took him away and brought him up as her own son. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Now when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the children of Israel. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And seeing one of <i>them</i> suffer wrong, he defended and avenged him who was oppressed, and struck down the Egyptian. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>For he supposed that his brethren would have understood that God would deliver them by his hand, but they did not understand. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And the next day he appeared to <i>two of</i> them as they were fighting, and <i>tried to</i> reconcile them, saying, &#x2018;Men, you are brethren; why do you wrong one another?&#x2019; </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, <span>&#x2018;Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?</span> </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup><span>Do you want to kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?&#x2019;</span>  </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Then, at this saying, Moses fled and became a dweller in the land of Midian, where he had two sons.</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;And when forty years had passed, an Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire in a bush, in the wilderness of Mount Sinai. </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>When Moses saw <i>it,</i> he marveled at the sight; and as he drew near to observe, the voice of the Lord came to him, </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup><i>saying,</i> <span>&#x2018;I</span> <i>am</i> <span>the God of your fathers&#x2014;the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&#x2019;</span>  And Moses trembled and dared not look. </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x2018;Then the L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span> said to him, &#x201C;Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.</span> </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup><span>I have surely seen the oppression of My people who are in Egypt; I have heard their groaning and have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.&#x201D;&#x2019;</span> </span></p><p><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;This Moses whom they rejected, saying, <span>&#x2018;Who made you a ruler and a judge?&#x2019;</span>  is the one God sent <i>to be</i> a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the Angel who appeared to him in the bush. </span> <span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>He brought them out, after he had shown wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.</span></p><p><span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel, <span>&#x2018;The L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span> your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brethren. Him you shall hear.&#x2019;</span> </span></p><p><span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the Angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and <i>with</i> our fathers, the one who received the living oracles to give to us, </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>whom our fathers would not obey, but rejected. And in their hearts they turned back to Egypt, </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>saying to Aaron, <span>&#x2018;Make us gods to go before us;</span> <i>as for</i> <span>this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>And they made a calf in those days, offered sacrifices to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. </span> <span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>Then God turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the Prophets:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x2018;Did you offer Me slaughtered animals and sacrifices</span> <i>during</i> <span>forty years in the wilderness,</span></span><br><span><span>O house of Israel?</span></span><br><span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup><span>You also took up the tabernacle of Moloch,</span></span><br><span><span>And the star of your god Remphan,</span></span><br><span><span>Images which you made to worship;</span></span><br><span><span>And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.&#x2019;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as He appointed, instructing Moses to make it according to the pattern that he had seen, </span> <span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>which our fathers, having received it in turn, also brought with Joshua into the land possessed by the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of David, </span> <span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>who found favor before God and asked to find a dwelling for the God of Jacob. </span> <span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>But Solomon built Him a house.</span></p><p><span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;However, the Most High does not dwell in temples made with hands, as the prophet says:</span></p><p><span><sup>49&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x2018;Heaven <i>is</i> My throne,</span></span><br><span><span>And earth</span> <i>is</i> <span>My footstool.</span></span><br><span><span>What house will you build for Me? says the L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span>,</span></span><br><span><span>Or what</span> <i>is</i> <span>the place of My rest?</span></span><br><span><sup>50&#xA0;</sup><span>Has My hand not made all these things?&#x2019;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>51&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;<i>You</i> stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers <i>did,</i> so <i>do</i> you. </span> <span><sup>52&#xA0;</sup>Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Just One, of whom you now have become the betrayers and murderers, </span> <span><sup>53&#xA0;</sup>who have received the law by the direction of angels and have not kept <i>it.</i>&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>54&#xA0;</sup>When they heard these things they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at him with <i>their</i> teeth. </span> <span><sup>55&#xA0;</sup>But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, </span> <span><sup>56&#xA0;</sup>and said, &#x201C;Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>57&#xA0;</sup>Then they cried out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, and ran at him with one accord; </span> <span><sup>58&#xA0;</sup>and they cast <i>him</i> out of the city and stoned <i>him.</i> And the witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul. </span> <span><sup>59&#xA0;</sup>And they stoned Stephen as he was calling on <i>God</i> and saying, &#x201C;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>60&#xA0;</sup>Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, &#x201C;Lord, do not charge them with this sin.&#x201D; And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</span></p>'

**Exploration** _(<a class="verse" verse="Acts 11:18">Acts 11:18</a>)_

**CONCLUDE**

Next to Jesus Christ Himself, few people have contributed more to our current understanding of the Christian faith than the apostle Paul. By his own admission, Paul—formerly Saul—mercilessly persecuted the church in an effort to destroy (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 1:13">Gal. 1:13</a>). Some theologians have mused that Saul was so effective at “wasting” the church that God had no choice but to put him out of commission—to knock him off the “horse” of his misplaced zeal. But God didn’t stop there. He forgave Saul, changed his name, and set him to the task of sharing the gospel with Gentile believers. To his credit, Paul employed the same dedication to this task as he had when persecuting those who believed in The Way. We are the beneficiaries of Paul’s faithful preaching of the gospel to both the Jews and the Gentiles.

**CONSIDER**

- Reading <a class="verse" verse="Zechariah 8:22">Zechariah 8:22</a>. Write a journal entry explaining the meaning of this very important verse in your own words.
- Comparing and contrasting the actions of Saul in <a class="verse" verse="Acts 7">Acts 7</a> and 8 with other “bad actors” in Scripture. Make a list of people in the Bible whose lives were transformed by God. Give an example of someone whose transformation was as radical as was Saul’s transformation.
- Drawing scenes depicting some of the challenges the apostle Paul endured during his ministry. In <a class="verse" verse="2 Corinthians 11:23–27">2 Corinthians 11:23–27</a>, Paul recites what he has suffered for the cause of Christ. How did Paul remain steadfast through all of this?
- Praying for lay members and ministers around the world who are sharing the gospel in difficult places and situations. Believers today continue to suffer and give their lives to prepare men and women to meet God in peace.
- Mapping the cities and towns that the apostle Paul visited during his missionary journeys. Choose one city on Paul’s itinerary to research. Record whether or not there remains a Christian presence in that city. Is there a Seventh-day Adventist church or mission in that city?
