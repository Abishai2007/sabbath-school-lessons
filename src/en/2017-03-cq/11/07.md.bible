            '1 Cor 7:23;': '<h3>1 Corinthians 7:23</h3><sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. '
            'Gal 5:1–15': '<h3>Galatians 5:1-15</h3><span class="chapternum">5&#xA0;</span>Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing. <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law. <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>You have become estranged from Christ, you who <i>attempt to</i> be justified by law; you have fallen from grace. <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. <sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love.<sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>You ran well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? <sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>This persuasion does not <i>come</i> from Him who calls you. <sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>A little leaven leavens the whole lump. <sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will have no other mind; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is.<sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then the offense of the cross has ceased. <sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>I could wish that those who trouble you would even cut themselves off!<sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not <i>use</i> liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, <i>even</i> in this: <span class="oblique">&#x201C;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another!'
            'Rom 13:8;': '<h3>Romans 13:8</h3><sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law. '

**Conclude**

Our salvation is free—yet it cost our Savior an incalculable price. Life in Jesus equals freedom—yet if we exploit that freedom to just do whatever we desire, we enslave ourselves anew. How do we resolve this tension? Through the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit empowers us to serve God and love others.The Spirit empowers us to escape the chains of sin and the self-enforced prison of perfectionism. When we know that nothing we can do can either earn or take away God’s love, we are empowered to live to give God glory.

**Consider**

- Sketching an image of breaking the bonds of spiritual slavery.
- Examining your heart as to how captive you may yet be to old patterns of thinking and acting.
- Refuting arguments against perfectionism and licentiousness.
- Dancing an interpretive dance that illustrates the freedom you’ve found in Jesus.
- Singing and/or playing “Jesus, I Come,” no. 292 in the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal.
- Brainstorming ways you can live life to the fullest in Jesus.
- Journaling on what it means to “love one another.”
