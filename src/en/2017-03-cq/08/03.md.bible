            'Heb 2:14–18; 4:14, 15': '<h3>Hebrews 2:14-18</h3><sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham. <sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, in all things He had to be made like <i>His</i> brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things <i>pertaining</i> to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted.<h3>Hebrews 4:14, 15</h3><sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i>our</i> confession. <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all <i>points</i> tempted as <i>we are, yet</i> without sin.

Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it? <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.<sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be <i>in the likeness</i> of <i>His</i> resurrection, <sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>knowing this, that our old man was crucified with <i>Him,</i> that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. <sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>For he who has died has been freed from sin. <sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, <sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. <sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>For <i>the death</i> that He died, He died to sin once for all; but <i>the life</i> that He lives, He lives to God. <sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.<h3>Romans 8:17</h3><sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>and if children, then heirs&#x2014;heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with <i>Him,</i> that we may also be glorified together.'

**Logos**: <a class="verse" verse="Gal 3:25–29">Gal. 3:25–29</a>

**Our Condition in Christ** (<a class="verse" verse="Job 29:14;">Job 29:14;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Rom 6:1–11; 8:17;">Rom. 6:1–11; 8:17;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Gal 3:25– 29;">Gal. 3:25– 29;</a> <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 3:21">1 Pet. 3:21</a>)

“And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise” (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 3:29, ">Gal. 3:29, </a>NKJV). We can only “be Christ’s” if we surrender our lives to Him and are born again. Baptism is not the removal of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward God (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 3:21">1 Pet. 3:21</a>). During a baptism service, we might hear the pastor or the elder referring to the candidates entering the “watery grave.” That’s exactly what it is, because this is where we are reborn.We let go of what we were and come out as the new beings Christ wants us to be:His people.We do not belong to Satan.By getting baptized, we have chosen whose side we are on.

**We are His heirs.**

However, it does not stop there.Yes, we are new.Yes, heaven rejoices, but Satan is mad and wants to get us back on his side.As a result, he tries everything to get us back on his side. However, rest assured because we can receive somuchmoreifweremainin Christ.Itiswhere we belong.WehaveHis promises that reassure us of this: “ ‘If you ask anything in My name, I will do it’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="John 14:14, ">John 14:14, </a>NKJV); “For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope” (<a class="verse" verse="Jer 29:11, ">Jer. 29:11, </a>NKJV); “ ‘Therefore do not worry, saying, “What shall we eat?” or “What shall we drink?” or “What shall we wear?” ’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 6:31, ">Matt. 6:31, </a>NKJV). Verse 33 continues by saying, “ ‘But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you’ ” (NKJV). What more could one hope for or want when we have these promises?

**God Sent Forth His Son** (<a class="verse" verse="John 1:14;">John 1:14;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:4, 5;">Gal. 4:4, 5;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Rom 8:3, 4;">Rom. 8:3, 4;</a> <a class="verse" verse="2 Cor 5:21;">2 Cor. 5:21;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Phil 2:5–8;">Phil. 2:5–8;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Heb 2:14–18; 4:14, 15">Heb. 2:14–18; 4:14, 15</a>)

Why did Jesus come to earth? Our usual answer is “to seek and save that which was lost,” but why did this need to happen? Let’s go back to the begin-ning.AfterAdam and Eve had eaten the fruit, God made His plan of salvation known. “And I will put enmity / Between you and the woman, / And between your seed and her Seed;/ He shall bruise your head, /And you shall bruise His heel”(<a class="verse" verse="Gen3:15, ">Gen.3:15, </a>NKJV).This text foretells that Jesus would come “to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons” (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:5, ">Gal. 4:5, </a>NKJV).

When Jesus was on Earth, He showed us that even though the world is full of sin, it is possible to live a sinless life. He is able to sympathize with our weaknesses, because He was tempted when at His weakest yet remained sinless (<a class="verse" verse="Heb4:14, 15">Heb.4:14, 15</a>). He also showed us how we should live. He knew that He is the Son of the Most High, yet He came as a baby, lived a less-than-average life, without any “airs and graces.” Why do we find it hard to do the same? In order to make it to heaven, we have to live the way Jesus did and have the same mind-set (<a class="verse" verse="Phil 2:5–8">Phil 2:5–8</a>).

When Jesus said “It is finished” and the veil in the temple tore from top to bottom, He meant that the ceremonial laws were no more. We don’t need to perform sacrifices—Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice! We don’t need a mortal high priest—Jesus is our High Priest! He is there interceding on our part. We now have direct access to our Father in heaven.

**Why Turn Back to Slavery?** (<a class="verse" verse="Mark 2:27, 28;">Mark 2:27, 28;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Luke 13:10–16;">Luke 13:10–16;</a> <a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:8–20">Gal. 4:8–20</a>)

The Sabbath was made for us. We weren’t made for the Sabbath (<a class="verse" verse="Mark 2:27, 28">Mark 2:27, 28</a>). God wanted us to have that day to rest. Can you imagine working for eight hours a day, seven days a week? We would be drained emotionally and physically. God had a plan. He didn’t have to rest on the seventh day, but He did. Why? He wanted to show us the purpose of the Sabbath and how to observe it.

There is an argument about the Sabbath not being there at Creation. But let’s think about this: our parents taught us to speak, how to hold our bottle, and how to use the spoon. Crawling, walking, and running, all, we learned by watching. In the same way, even though the commandments weren’t there at Creation, the Sabbath had been kept since the beginning, as our parents in Eden had learned from their Creator. It was passed down through the generations to the time of Moses. However, when Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt, God saw that they were not living the life He intended them to live, and He wrote the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai. God wants us to worship Him, not be slaves to this world and all it has to offer.

When Jesus walked on Earth, He performed miracles: healing the sick, causing the blind to see, raising the dead, and many, many more. In <a class="verse" verse="Luke 13:10–16, ">Luke 13:10–16, </a>Jesus was accused of breaking the Sabbath, but He in actual fact was showing us what could be done on the Sabbath. Laws are there to guide us. God loves us with an everlasting love. He has shown this to us in many ways. However, we choose the world over Him time and time again. God is waiting to come into our hearts (<a class="verse" verse="Rev 3:20">Rev. 3:20</a>). Once we let Him in, He will take usto places that fadein comparison towhatthis world has to offer.WeareHis heirs.

`1. How does it feel to know that you are not a mere number in this world, but an heir?`
