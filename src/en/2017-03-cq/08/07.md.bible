            '2 Corinthians 12:9': '<h3>2 Corinthians 12:9.</h3><sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>And He said to me, <span class="woj">&#x201C;My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.&#x201D;</span> Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. '
            'Matthew 11:28–30;': '<h3>Matthew 11:28-30</h3><sup class="versenum">28&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">Come to Me, all <i>you</i> who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span> <sup class="versenum">29&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</span> <sup class="versenum">30&#xA0;</sup><span class="woj">For My yoke <i>is</i> easy and My burden is light.&#x201D;</span>'
            'Romans 6:1–11, ': '<h3>Romans 6:1-11</h3><span class="chapternum">6&#xA0;</span>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it? <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.<sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be <i>in the likeness</i> of <i>His</i> resurrection, <sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>knowing this, that our old man was crucified with <i>Him,</i> that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. <sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>For he who has died has been freed from sin. <sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, <sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more.

            'Romans 8:18–20 ': '<h3>Romans 8:18-20</h3><sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy <i>to be compared</i> with the glory which shall be revealed in us. <sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God. <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected <i>it</i> in hope; '

**Conclude**

The thought of being enslaved to anything in life fills most human beings with dread.Yet, across our world each day we witness people who are slaves to pleasure, illicit drugs, consumerism, violence, and a host of other ills. It is into this milieu that God beckons us to become slaves to Jesus Christ. While many in our culture see submission to the life offered by Jesus Christ as little more than an invitation for exploitation with a faint promise of something better to come, those who take Christ up on His offer receive a “grace exchange.” They receive His sinless life; His atoning death; His resurrection power; His intercession in the heavenly sanctuary on their behalf; and, one day soon, His return. The slavery to which Christ invites us is one in which we obtain true freedom and gain peace with God.

**Consider**

- Conducting video interviews with several friends, asking each to respond to the following questions: What does it mean to be a slave to sin? What does it mean to be a slave to Jesus Christ? Why do some people choose to remain under the yoke of sin instead of accepting the yoke of Jesus Christ?
- Reading and meditating on <a class="verse" verse="Romans 6:1–11, ">Romans 6:1–11, </a>specifically on what the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ accomplished for human beings.
- Analyzing the way in which faiths such as Hinduism, Buddhism, or Islam address the issue of sin and salvation—if those faiths hold such teachings. Compare and contrast the way provided for human beings to overcome sin with the one found in <a class="verse" verse="2 Corinthians 5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21.</a>
- Composing a song based on <a class="verse" verse="John 1:14">John 1:14.</a>Think about the spiritual condition of the world at the time when Jesus arrived. Furthermore, consider the form Jesus took to begin this most important of tasks.
- Sharing with a friend your personal testimony of the difference Jesus made in your life after you surrendered it to Him.
- Thinking of how Christ’s sacrifice has affected the natural world. What does <a class="verse" verse="Romans 8:18–20 ">Romans 8:18–20 </a>tell us about how sin affected the natural world? Why is the created world yearning for the sons of God to be revealed?
