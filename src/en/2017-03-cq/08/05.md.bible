            'Galatians 4, ': '<h3>Galatians 4</h3><span class="chapternum">4&#xA0;</span>Now I say <i>that</i> the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all, <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world. <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.<sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, &#x201C;Abba, Father!&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.<sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods. <sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>But now after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how <i>is it that</i> you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage? <sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>You observe days and months and seasons and years. <sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain.<sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I <i>became</i> like you. You have not injured me at all. <sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first. <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, <i>even</i> as Christ Jesus. <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>What then was the blessing you <i>enjoyed?</i> For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?<sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>They zealously court you, <i>but</i> for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you. <sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you, <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.<sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>But he <i>who was</i> of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. <sup class="versenum">27&#xA0;</sup>For it is written:<span class="oblique">&#x201C;Rejoice, O barren,</span><i>You</i> <span class="oblique">who do not bear!</span><span class="oblique">Break forth and shout,</span><span class="oblique">You who are not in labor!</span><span class="oblique">For the desolate has many more children</span><span class="oblique">Than she who has a husband.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">28&#xA0;</sup>Now we, brethren, as Isaac <i>was,</i> are children of promise. <sup class="versenum">29&#xA0;</sup>But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him <i>who was born</i> according to the Spirit, even so <i>it is</i> now. <sup class="versenum">30&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? <span class="oblique">&#x201C;Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">31&#xA0;</sup>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.'
            'Gal 4:1-7': '<h3>Galatians 4:1-7</h3><span class="chapternum">4&#xA0;</span>Now I say <i>that</i> the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all, <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world. <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.<sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, &#x201C;Abba, Father!&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.'

**How-to**: <a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:1-7">Gal. 4:1-7</a>

When we look at the word slave, it has a very negative connotation. The following definition is taken from Merriam-Webster: “Someone who is legally owned by another person and is forced to work for that person without pay.”1 This is also our general understanding of a slave; however, the second definition of a slave seems more appropriate in our daily lives: “A person who is strongly influenced and controlled by something.” I think that in our daily lives we have become slaves unto ourselves, and there are so many things that we have control over, but we just let them control us.

**We are given the opportunity to just claim the promise to be royalty.**

Now if we look at the term heir, it makes us feel as though we’ve just taken a 180-degree turn. As per Merriam-Webster the definition of an heir is, “A person who has the legal right to receive the property of someone who dies,” or “a person who has the right to become a king or queen or to claim a title when the person holding it dies.”2

When we look at these two terms, it is like chalk and cheese or more like an extreme case of a low-class society and high-class society with absolutely no middle ground. In <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4, ">Galatians 4, </a>we can see that they are told not to live and act as slaves but to embrace the rights and privileges of an heir because they are sons and daughters of God. How awesome is that! We are given the opportunity to just claim the promise to be royalty. Here are a few ways we may go about doing this:

_1. Look around and identify what enslaves us._ This could be anything from the things we do to people we spend time with and so forth.

_2. Identify the how and why._ Figure out why this item or thing has us in its snare and how we ended up in this position where the thing that we have been given dominion to control controls us.

_3. Make a pointed effort to break this._ If, for example, you are strapped for time, take five minutes. Sit back and reanalyze everything. Is all that you’re doing necessary? How can you rearrange it so that you are managing your own time and not being managed by it?

All of these small day-to-day things, if managed correctly, can ultimately lead us to our spiritual freedom.
