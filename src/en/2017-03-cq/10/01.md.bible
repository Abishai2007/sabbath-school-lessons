            'Galatians 4, ': '<h3>Galatians 4</h3><span class="chapternum">4&#xA0;</span>Now I say <i>that</i> the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all, <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world. <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.<sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, &#x201C;Abba, Father!&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.<sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods. <sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>But now after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how <i>is it that</i> you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage? <sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>You observe days and months and seasons and years. <sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain.<sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I <i>became</i> like you. You have not injured me at all. <sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first. <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, <i>even</i> as Christ Jesus. <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>What then was the blessing you <i>enjoyed?</i> For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?<sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>They zealously court you, <i>but</i> for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you. <sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you, <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.<sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>But he <i>who was</i> of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. <sup class="versenum">27&#xA0;</sup>For it is written:<span class="oblique">&#x201C;Rejoice, O barren,</span><i>You</i> <span class="oblique">who do not bear!</span><span class="oblique">Break forth and shout,</span><span class="oblique">You who are not in labor!</span><span class="oblique">For the desolate has many more children</span><span class="oblique">Than she who has a husband.&#x201D;</span><sup class="versenum">28&#xA0;</sup>Now we, brethren, as Isaac <i>was,</i> are children of promise. <sup class="versenum">29&#xA0;</sup>But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him <i>who was born</i> according to the Spirit, even so <i>it is</i> now. <sup class="versenum">30&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? <span class="oblique">&#x201C;Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.&#x201D;</span> <sup class="versenum">31&#xA0;</sup>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.'
            'Gal 4:26, ': '<h3>Galatians 4:26</h3><sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. '
            'Gal 4:30': '<h3>Galatians 4:30</h3><sup class="versenum">30&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? <span class="oblique">&#x201C;Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.&#x201D;</span> '

**Introduction**: <a class="verse" verse="Gal 4:30">Gal. 4:30</a>

**Who’s Your Mama?**

As a teenager I grappled with the law and how it affected my life. I felt as if it was impossible to keep. I was tired of disappointing God, so I quit Christianity. I quit it because in my mind there is no point playing a game you cannot win. I was failing God every time I got off my knees. My failure did not just affect how I viewed myself, it began to damage my view of God as a Creator and Savior. If God is so loving, why would He give me an impossible task? If God wants the best for me, why let me play a game He knows I will lose? There I was, failing—failing to see God for who He truly is.

**So there I was; I really thought leaving God would help me feel better, but it only caused me to feel worse.**

Time went on, and I wrestled with my failures, knowing that even though I did not want anything to do with Him, I still felt pain when I realized I had failed Him. I went to church in pain; I went to school in pain; I went through life in pain because I knew that I was a failure. I knew that I always found a way to mess up but remained lost on my journey to perfection. So there I was; I really thought leaving God would help me feel better, but it only caused me to feel worse.

In <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 4, ">Galatians 4, </a>Paul describes two mothers—one mother is free and the other is a slave. While he doesn’t explicitly say this, it seems as though he’s continuously asking the question: Who’s your mother? Because of sin, you are born of a slave, but God in His mercy has given you the choice to decide.Who’s your mother? My mother seems to havebeen a slavenamed Failure because I naturally kept on failing God. Still, for some odd reason, God still gives me the choice to rewrite my birth certificate, giving me a new mother.

We might not be perfect and have it all together, but God really wants us to be a part of His family. It’s not about getting it right; it’s not about being perfect;it’s all about choosing.Throughout this lesson, the hope is that you will choose for yourself: will you remain as the daughter or son of a slave, or will you rewrite your birth certificate as a child of God?

`2. How do our daily choices reflect who we believe our mother to be?`
