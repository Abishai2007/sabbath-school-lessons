They are given into your hand. <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have given you all things, even as the green herbs. <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>But you shall not eat flesh with its life, <i>that is,</i> its blood. <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>Surely for your lifeblood I will demand <i>a reckoning;</i> from the hand of every beast I will require it, and from the hand of man. From the hand of every man&#x2019;s brother I will require the life of man.<sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Whoever sheds man&#x2019;s blood,By man his blood shall be shed;For in the image of GodHe made man.<sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>And as for you, be fruitful and multiply;Bring forth abundantly in the earthAnd multiply in it.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying: <sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;And as for Me, behold, I establish My covenant with you and with your descendants after you, <sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>and with every living creature that <i>is</i> with you: the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ark, every beast of the earth. <sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>Thus I establish My covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood; never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>And God said: &#x201C;This <i>is</i> the sign of the covenant which I make between Me and you, and every living creature that <i>is</i> with you, for perpetual generations: <sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth. <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>It shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud; <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>and I will remember My covenant which <i>is</i> between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will look on it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that <i>is</i> on the earth.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>And God said to Noah, &#x201C;This <i>is</i> the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that <i>is</i> on the earth.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>Now the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And Ham <i>was</i> the father of Canaan. <sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>These three <i>were</i> the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was populated.<sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>And Noah began <i>to be</i> a farmer, and he planted a vineyard. <sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>Then he drank of the wine and was drunk, and became uncovered in his tent. <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside. <sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>But Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid <i>it</i> on both their shoulders, and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces <i>were</i> turned away, and they did not see their father&#x2019;s nakedness.<sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>So Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him. <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>Then he said:&#x201C;Cursed <i>be</i> Canaan;A servant of servantsHe shall be to his brethren.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>And he said:&#x201C;Blessed <i>be</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,The God of Shem,And may Canaan be his servant.<sup class="versenum">27&#xA0;</sup>May God enlarge Japheth,And may he dwell in the tents of Shem;And may Canaan be his servant.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">28&#xA0;</sup>And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. <sup class="versenum">29&#xA0;</sup>So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.<h3>Genesis 15</h3><span class="chapternum">15&#xA0;</span>After these things the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to Abram in a vision, saying, &#x201C;Do not be afraid, Abram. I <i>am</i> your shield, your exceedingly great reward.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>But Abram said, &#x201C;Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, what will You give me, seeing I go childless, and the heir of my house <i>is</i> Eliezer of Damascus?&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Then Abram said, &#x201C;Look, You have given me no offspring; indeed one born in my house is my heir!&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>And behold, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> <i>came</i> to him, saying, &#x201C;This one shall not be your heir, but one who will come from your own body shall be your heir.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>Then He brought him outside and said, &#x201C;Look now toward heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them.&#x201D; And He said to him, &#x201C;So shall your descendants be.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>And he believed in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and He accounted it to him for righteousness.<sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>Then He said to him, &#x201C;I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to inherit it.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>And he said, &#x201C;Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, how shall I know that I will inherit it?&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>So He said to him, &#x201C;Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, down the middle, and placed each piece opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds in two. <sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>And when the vultures came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.<sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, horror <i>and</i> great darkness fell upon him. <sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>Then He said to Abram: &#x201C;Know certainly that your descendants will be strangers in a land <i>that is</i> not theirs, and will serve them, and they will afflict them four hundred years. <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>And also the nation whom they serve I will judge; afterward they shall come out with great possessions. <sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>Now as for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried at a good old age. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>But in the fourth generation they shall return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites <i>is</i> not yet complete.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>And it came to pass, when the sun went down and it was dark, that behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a burning torch that passed between those pieces. <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>On the same day the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> made a covenant with Abram, saying:&#x201C;To your descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the River Euphrates&#x2014; <sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>the Kenites, the Kenezzites, the Kadmonites, <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, <sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.&#x201D;<h3>Genesis 17</h3><span class="chapternum">17&#xA0;</span>When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to Abram and said to him, &#x201C;I <i>am</i> Almighty God; walk before Me and be blameless. <sup class="versenum">2&#xA0;</sup>And I will make My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">3&#xA0;</sup>Then Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying: <sup class="versenum">4&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of many nations. <sup class="versenum">5&#xA0;</sup>No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you a father of many nations. <sup class="versenum">6&#xA0;</sup>I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you. <sup class="versenum">7&#xA0;</sup>And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you. <sup class="versenum">8&#xA0;</sup>Also I give to you and your descendants after you the land in which you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">9&#xA0;</sup>And God said to Abraham: &#x201C;As for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations. <sup class="versenum">10&#xA0;</sup>This <i>is</i> My covenant which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: Every male child among you shall be circumcised; <sup class="versenum">11&#xA0;</sup>and you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and you. <sup class="versenum">12&#xA0;</sup>He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised, every male child in your generations, he who is born in your house or bought with money from any foreigner who is not your descendant. <sup class="versenum">13&#xA0;</sup>He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised, and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. <sup class="versenum">14&#xA0;</sup>And the uncircumcised male child, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">15&#xA0;</sup>Then God said to Abraham, &#x201C;As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah <i>shall be</i> her name. <sup class="versenum">16&#xA0;</sup>And I will bless her and also give you a son by her; then I will bless her, and she shall be <i>a mother of</i> nations; kings of peoples shall be from her.&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">17&#xA0;</sup>Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, &#x201C;Shall <i>a child</i> be born to a man who is one hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear <i>a child?</i>&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">18&#xA0;</sup>And Abraham said to God, &#x201C;Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!&#x201D;<sup class="versenum">19&#xA0;</sup>Then God said: &#x201C;No, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, <i>and</i> with his descendants after him. <sup class="versenum">20&#xA0;</sup>And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall beget twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. <sup class="versenum">21&#xA0;</sup>But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this set time next year.&#x201D; <sup class="versenum">22&#xA0;</sup>Then He finished talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.<sup class="versenum">23&#xA0;</sup>So Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham&#x2019;s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very same day, as God had said to him. <sup class="versenum">24&#xA0;</sup>Abraham <i>was</i> ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. <sup class="versenum">25&#xA0;</sup>And Ishmael his son <i>was</i> thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. <sup class="versenum">26&#xA0;</sup>That very same day Abraham was circumcised, and his son Ishmael; <sup class="versenum">27&#xA0;</sup>and all the men of his house, born in the house or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.'
            'Jeremiah 31:33, ': '<h3>Jeremiah 31:33</h3><sup class="versenum">33&#xA0;</sup>But this <i>is</i> the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.

**Conclude**

In the Old Testament covenant at Sinai, God defined His relationship with His chosen nation, Israel. It was like a marriage agreement or a promise between God and His people. His law (a description of His character) was given to show them how to live in healthy relationships with Him and one another, which was necessary for such a large nation that had been immersed in pagan culture for four hundred years. In contrast, the new covenant is offered to anyone who chooses to believe in and accept Christ and is based on what He has done for His people for eternity. Both covenants are based on grace. Both are offered from a loving God. Both involve a reciprocal relationship of blessing and mutual engagement.
