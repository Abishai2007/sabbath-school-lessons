            'Matt 14:13–33': '<h3> <span>Matthew 14:13-33</span></h3><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>When Jesus heard <i>it,</i> He departed from there by boat to a deserted place by Himself. But when the multitudes heard it, they followed Him on foot from the cities. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>When it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, &#x201C;This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>But Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>And they said to Him, &#x201C;We have here only five loaves and two fish.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>He said, <span>&#x201C;Bring them here to Me.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Then He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>So they all ate and were filled, and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Now those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, while He sent the multitudes away. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. Now when evening came, He was alone there. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, &#x201C;It is a ghost!&#x201D; And they cried out for fear.</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span>&#x201C;Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And Peter answered Him and said, &#x201C;Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>So He said, <span>&#x201C;Come.&#x201D;</span> And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>But when he saw that the wind <i>was</i> boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, &#x201C;Lord, save me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>And immediately Jesus stretched out <i>His</i> hand and caught him, and said to him, <span>&#x201C;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, &#x201C;Truly You are the Son of God.&#x201D;</span></p>'
            'Mark 6:30–52': '<h3> <span>Mark 6:30-52</span></h3><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught. </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>And He said to them, <span>&#x201C;Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.&#x201D;</span> For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>So they departed to a deserted place in the boat by themselves.</span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>But the multitudes saw them departing, and many knew Him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to Him. </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>And Jesus, when He came out, saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep not having a shepherd. So He began to teach them many things. </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>When the day was now far spent, His disciples came to Him and said, &#x201C;This is a deserted place, and already the hour <i>is</i> late. </span> <span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>But He answered and said to them, <span>&#x201C;You give them something to eat.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span>And they said to Him, &#x201C;Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them <i>something</i> to eat?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>But He said to them, <span>&#x201C;How many loaves do you have? Go and see.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span>And when they found out they said, &#x201C;Five, and two fish.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>Then He commanded them to make them all sit down in groups on the green grass. </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>So they sat down in ranks, in hundreds and in fifties. </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>And when He had taken the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to heaven, blessed and broke the loaves, and gave <i>them</i> to His disciples to set before them; and the two fish He divided among <i>them</i> all. </span> <span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>So they all ate and were filled. </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and of the fish. </span> <span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>Now those who had eaten the loaves were about five thousand men.</span></p><p><span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>Immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He sent the multitude away. </span> <span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>And when He had sent them away, He departed to the mountain to pray. </span> <span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>Now when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea; and He <i>was</i> alone on the land. </span> <span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>Then He saw them straining at rowing, for the wind was against them. Now about the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea, and would have passed them by. </span> <span><sup>49&#xA0;</sup>And when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed it was a ghost, and cried out; </span> <span><sup>50&#xA0;</sup>for they all saw Him and were troubled. But immediately He talked with them and said to them, <span>&#x201C;Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>51&#xA0;</sup>Then He went up into the boat to them, and the wind ceased. And they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure, and marveled. </span> <span><sup>52&#xA0;</sup>For they had not understood about the loaves, because their heart was hardened.</span></p>'
            'John 6:1–21': '<h3> <span>John 6:1-21</span></h3><p><span><span>6&#xA0;</span>After these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is <i>the Sea</i> of Tiberias. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Then a great multitude followed Him, because they saw His signs which He performed on those who were diseased. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat with His disciples.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Now the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was near. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus lifted up <i>His</i> eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward Him, He said to Philip, <span>&#x201C;Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Philip answered Him, &#x201C;Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may have a little.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter&#x2019;s brother, said to Him, </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;Make the people sit down.&#x201D;</span> Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks He distributed <i>them</i> to the disciples, and the disciples to those sitting down; and likewise of the fish, as much as they wanted. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>So when they were filled, He said to His disciples, <span>&#x201C;Gather up the fragments that remain, so that nothing is lost.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Therefore they gathered <i>them</i> up, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, &#x201C;This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Therefore when Jesus perceived that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king, He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>got into the boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was already dark, and Jesus had not come to them. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Then the sea arose because a great wind was blowing. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>But He said to them, <span>&#x201C;It is I; do not be afraid.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Then they willingly received Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</span></p>'

### “Lord, Save Me!”

<a class="verse" verse="Matt 14:13–33">Matt. 14:13–33</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Mark 6:30–52">Mark 6:30–52</a>; <a class="verse" verse="John 6:1–21">John 6:1–21</a>

“ At the moment when they believe themselves lost, a gleam of light reveals a mysterious figure approaching them upon the water. But they know not that it is Jesus. The One who has come for their help they count as an enemy. . . .

“They think it a phantom that omens their destruction, and they cry out for fear. Jesus advances as if He would pass them; but they recognize Him, and cry out, entreating His help. Their beloved Master turns, His voice silences their fear, ‘Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.’

**“Christ is hidden from his view, and his faith gives way.”**

“ As soon as they could credit the wondrous fact, Peter was almost beside himself with joy. As if he could scarcely yet believe, he cried out, ‘Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come unto Thee on the water. And He said, Come.’

“Looking unto Jesus, Peter walks securely; but as in self-satisfaction he glances back toward his companions in the boat, his eyes are turned from the Saviour. The wind is boisterous. The waves roll high, and come directly between him and the Master; and he is afraid. For a moment Christ is hidden from his view, and his faith gives way. He begins to sink. But while the billows talk with death, Peter lifts his eyes from the angry waters, and fixing them upon Jesus, cries, ‘Lord, save me.’ Immediately Jesus grasps the outstretched hand, saying, ‘O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?’ . . .

“When trouble comes upon us, how often we are like Peter! We look upon the waves, instead of keeping our eyes fixed upon the Saviour. Our footsteps slide, and the proud waters go over our souls. Jesus did not bid Peter come to Him that he should perish; He does not call us to follow Him, and then forsake us.”*

`1. In what ways do you take your eyes off Jesus during difficult times? What kinds of things distract you from maintaining your focus on Him?`

`2. Think of times in your life when you were certain that you could do everything on your own. What transpired that made you realize you were unable to save yourself?`

`3. When you feel overcome in your own life, do you call out to Jesus?`
