            '1 Pet 2:5–10': '<h3> <span>1 Peter 2:5-10</span></h3><p> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture,</span></p><p><span><span>&#x201C;Behold, I lay in Zion</span></span><br><span><span>A chief cornerstone, elect, precious,</span></span><br><span><span>And he who believes on Him will by no means be put to shame.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, to you who believe, <i>He is</i> precious; but to those who are disobedient,</span></p><p><span><span>&#x201C;The stone which the builders rejected</span></span><br><span><span>Has become the chief cornerstone,&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>and</span></p><p><span><span>&#x201C;A stone of stumbling</span></span><br><span><span>And a rock of offense.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span>They stumble, being disobedient to the word, to which they also were appointed.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>But you <i>are</i> a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>who once <i>were</i> not a people but <i>are</i> now the people of God, who had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy.</span></p>'
            'Gen 41:37–57': '<h3> <span>Genesis 41:37-57</span></h3><p><span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>So the advice was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants. </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>And Pharaoh said to his servants, &#x201C;Can we find <i>such a one</i> as this, a man in whom <i>is</i> the Spirit of God?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#x201C;Inasmuch as God has shown you all this, <i>there is</i> no one as discerning and wise as you. </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be ruled according to your word; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#x201C;See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>Then Pharaoh took his signet ring off his hand and put it on Joseph&#x2019;s hand; and he clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>And he had him ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried out before him, &#x201C;Bow the knee!&#x201D; So he set him over all the land of Egypt. </span> <span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>Pharaoh also said to Joseph, &#x201C;I <i>am</i> Pharaoh, and without your consent no man may lift his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>And Pharaoh called Joseph&#x2019;s name Zaphnath-Paaneah. And he gave him as a wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On. So Joseph went out over <i>all</i> the land of Egypt.</span></p><p><span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. </span> <span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>Now in the seven plentiful years the ground brought forth abundantly. </span> <span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>So he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities; he laid up in every city the food of the fields which surrounded them. </span> <span><sup>49&#xA0;</sup>Joseph gathered very much grain, as the sand of the sea, until he stopped counting, for <i>it was</i> immeasurable.</span></p><p><span><sup>50&#xA0;</sup>And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him. </span> <span><sup>51&#xA0;</sup>Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: &#x201C;For God has made me forget all my toil and all my father&#x2019;s house.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>52&#xA0;</sup>And the name of the second he called Ephraim: &#x201C;For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>53&#xA0;</sup>Then the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Egypt ended, </span> <span><sup>54&#xA0;</sup>and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. The famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. </span> <span><sup>55&#xA0;</sup>So when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Then Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, &#x201C;Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, do.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>56&#xA0;</sup>The famine was over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians. And the famine became severe in the land of Egypt. </span> <span><sup>57&#xA0;</sup>So all countries came to Joseph in Egypt to buy <i>grain,</i> because the famine was severe in all lands.</span></p>'
            'Leviticus 9': '<h3> <span>Leviticus 9</span></h3><p><span><span>9&#xA0;</span>It came to pass on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And he said to Aaron, &#x201C;Take for yourself a young bull as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer <i>them</i> before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, &#x2018;Take a kid of the goats as a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, <i>both</i> of the first year, without blemish, as a burnt offering, </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>also a bull and a ram as peace offerings, to sacrifice before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and a grain offering mixed with oil; for today the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will appear to you.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>So they brought what Moses commanded before the tabernacle of meeting. And all the congregation drew near and stood before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Then Moses said, &#x201C;This <i>is</i> the thing which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> commanded you to do, and the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will appear to you.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And Moses said to Aaron, &#x201C;Go to the altar, offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people. Offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> commanded.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Aaron therefore went to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which <i>was</i> for himself. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him. And he dipped his finger in the blood, put <i>it</i> on the horns of the altar, and poured the blood at the base of the altar. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>But the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe from the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded Moses. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>The flesh and the hide he burned with fire outside the camp.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And he killed the burnt offering; and Aaron&#x2019;s sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled all around on the altar. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Then they presented the burnt offering to him, with its pieces and head, and he burned <i>them</i> on the altar. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And he washed the entrails and the legs, and burned <i>them</i> with the burnt offering on the altar.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Then he brought the people&#x2019;s offering, and took the goat, which <i>was</i> the sin offering for the people, and killed it and offered it for sin, like the first one. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>And he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the prescribed manner. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Then he brought the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned <i>it</i> on the altar, besides the burnt sacrifice of the morning.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>He also killed the bull and the ram <i>as</i> sacrifices of peace offerings, which <i>were</i> for the people. And Aaron&#x2019;s sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled all around on the altar, </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>and the fat from the bull and the ram&#x2014;the fatty tail, what covers <i>the entrails</i> and the kidneys, and the fatty lobe <i>attached to</i> the liver; </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>and they put the fat on the breasts. Then he burned the fat on the altar; </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved <i>as</i> a wave offering before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, as Moses had commanded.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Then Aaron lifted his hand toward the people, blessed them, and came down from offering the sin offering, the burnt offering, and peace offerings. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of meeting, and came out and blessed the people. Then the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to all the people, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>and fire came out from before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar.

            'Daniel 1–6': '<h3> <span>Daniel 1-6</span></h3><p><span><span>1&#xA0;</span>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the articles of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the articles into the treasure house of his god.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then the king instructed Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, to bring some of the children of Israel and some of the king&#x2019;s descendants and some of the nobles, </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>young men in whom <i>there was</i> no blemish, but good-looking, gifted in all wisdom, possessing knowledge and quick to understand, who <i>had</i> ability to serve in the king&#x2019;s palace, and whom they might teach the language and literature of the Chaldeans. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And the king appointed for them a daily provision of the king&#x2019;s delicacies and of the wine which he drank, and three years of training for them, so that at the end of <i>that time</i> they might serve before the king. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Now from among those of the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>To them the chief of the eunuchs gave names: he gave Daniel <i>the name</i> Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abed-Nego.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king&#x2019;s delicacies, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Now God had brought Daniel into the favor and goodwill of the chief of the eunuchs. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, &#x201C;I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and drink. For why should he see your faces looking worse than the young men who <i>are</i> your age? Then you would endanger my head before the king.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>So Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Please test your servants for ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Then let our appearance be examined before you, and the appearance of the young men who eat the portion of the king&#x2019;s delicacies; and as you see fit, <i>so</i> deal with your servants.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>So he consented with them in this matter, and tested them ten days.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And at the end of ten days their features appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the young men who ate the portion of the king&#x2019;s delicacies. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Thus the steward took away their portion of delicacies and the wine that they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>As for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Now at the end of the days, when the king had said that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Then the king interviewed them, and among them all none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore they served before the king. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>And in all matters of wisdom <i>and</i> understanding about which the king examined them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians <i>and</i> astrologers who <i>were</i> in all his realm. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Thus Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus.</span></p><p><span><span>2&#xA0;</span>Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was <i>so</i> troubled that his sleep left him. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Then the king gave the command to call the magicians, the astrologers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And the king said to them, &#x201C;I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, &#x201C;O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, &#x201C;My decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream to me, and its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made an ash heap. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>However, if you tell the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>They answered again and said, &#x201C;Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will give its interpretation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>The king answered and said, &#x201C;I know for certain that you would gain time, because you see that my decision is firm: </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>if you do not make known the dream to me, <i>there is only</i> one decree for you! For you have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the time has changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can give me its interpretation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>The Chaldeans answered the king, and said, &#x201C;There is not a man on earth who can tell the king&#x2019;s matter; therefore no king, lord, or ruler has <i>ever</i> asked such things of any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup><i>It is</i> a difficult thing that the king requests, and there is no other who can tell it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>For this reason the king was angry and very furious, and gave the command to destroy all the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>So the decree went out, and they began killing the wise <i>men;</i> and they sought Daniel and his companions, to kill <i>them.</i></span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Then with counsel and wisdom Daniel answered Arioch, the captain of the king&#x2019;s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon; </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>he answered and said to Arioch the king&#x2019;s captain, &#x201C;Why is the decree from the king so urgent?&#x201D; Then Arioch made the decision known to Daniel.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>So Daniel went in and asked the king to give him time, that he might tell the king the interpretation. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the decision known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>that they might seek mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret, so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. So Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Daniel answered and said:</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Blessed be the name of God forever and ever,</span><br><span>For wisdom and might are His.</span><br><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And He changes the times and the seasons;</span><br><span>He removes kings and raises up kings;</span><br><span>He gives wisdom to the wise</span><br><span>And knowledge to those who have understanding.</span><br><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>He reveals deep and secret things;</span><br><span>He knows what <i>is</i> in the darkness,</span><br><span>And light dwells with Him.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;I thank You and praise You,</span><br><span>O God of my fathers;</span><br><span>You have given me wisdom and might,</span><br><span>And have now made known to me what we asked of You,</span><br><span>For You have made known to us the king&#x2019;s demand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: &#x201C;Do not destroy the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon; take me before the king, and I will tell the king the interpretation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king, and said thus to him, &#x201C;I have found a man of the captives of Judah, who will make known to the king the interpretation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name <i>was</i> Belteshazzar, &#x201C;Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, &#x201C;The secret which the king has demanded, the wise <i>men,</i> the astrologers, the magicians, and the soothsayers cannot declare to the king. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head upon your bed, were these: </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>As for you, O king, thoughts came <i>to</i> your <i>mind while</i> on your bed, <i>about</i> what would come to pass after this; and He who reveals secrets has made known to you what will be. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>But as for me, this secret has not been revealed to me because I have more wisdom than anyone living, but for <i>our</i> sakes who make known the interpretation to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You, O king, were watching; and behold, a great image! This great image, whose splendor <i>was</i> excellent, stood before you; and its form <i>was</i> awesome. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>This image&#x2019;s head <i>was</i> of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>You watched while a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;This <i>is</i> the dream. Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king. </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>You, O king, <i>are</i> a king of kings. For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory; </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>and wherever the children of men dwell, or the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven, He has given <i>them</i> into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all&#x2014;you <i>are</i> this head of gold. </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>But after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours; then another, a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth. </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything; and like iron that crushes, <i>that kingdom</i> will break in pieces and crush all the others. </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>Whereas you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter&#x2019;s clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with ceramic clay. </span> <span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>And <i>as</i> the toes of the feet <i>were</i> partly of iron and partly of clay, <i>so</i> the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile. </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay, they will mingle with the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay. </span> <span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>And in the days of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. </span> <span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold&#x2014;the great God has made known to the king what will come to pass after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is sure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, prostrate before Daniel, and commanded that they should present an offering and incense to him. </span> <span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>The king answered Daniel, and said, &#x201C;Truly your God <i>is</i> the God of gods, the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you could reveal this secret.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts; and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief administrator over all the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. </span> <span><sup>49&#xA0;</sup>Also Daniel petitioned the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel <i>sat</i> in the gate of the king.</span></p><p><span><span>3&#xA0;</span>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height <i>was</i> sixty cubits <i>and</i> its width six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And King Nebuchadnezzar sent <i>word</i> to gather together the satraps, the administrators, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>So the satraps, the administrators, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered together for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Then a herald cried aloud: &#x201C;To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup><i>that</i> at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, <i>and</i> psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, you shall fall down and worship the gold image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up; </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>So at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, harp, <i>and</i> lyre, in symphony with all kinds of music, all the people, nations, and languages fell down <i>and</i> worshiped the gold image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and accused the Jews. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>They spoke and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, &#x201C;O king, live forever! </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>You, O king, have made a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, <i>and</i> psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the gold image; </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego; these men, O king, have not paid due regard to you.

Then she sent garments to clothe Mordecai and take his sackcloth away from him, but he would not accept <i>them.</i> </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Then Esther called Hathach, <i>one</i> of the king&#x2019;s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and she gave him a command concerning Mordecai, to learn what and why this <i>was.</i> </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square that <i>was</i> in front of the king&#x2019;s gate. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king&#x2019;s treasuries to destroy the Jews. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>He also gave him a copy of the written decree for their destruction, which was given at Shushan, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her, and that he might command her to go in to the king to make supplication to him and plead before him for her people. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>So Hathach returned and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a command for Mordecai: </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;All the king&#x2019;s servants and the people of the king&#x2019;s provinces know that any man or woman who goes into the inner court to the king, who has not been called, <i>he has</i> but one law: put <i>all</i> to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter, that he may live. Yet I myself have not been called to go in to the king these thirty days.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>So they told Mordecai Esther&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And Mordecai told <i>them</i> to answer Esther: &#x201C;Do not think in your heart that you will escape in the king&#x2019;s palace any more than all the other Jews. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father&#x2019;s house will perish. Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for <i>such</i> a time as this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Then Esther told <i>them</i> to reply to Mordecai: </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Go, gather all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me; neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. My maids and I will fast likewise. And so I will go to the king, which <i>is</i> against the law; and if I perish, I perish!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>So Mordecai went his way and did according to all that Esther commanded him.</span></p><p><span><span>5&#xA0;</span>Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on <i>her</i> royal <i>robes</i> and stood in the inner court of the king&#x2019;s palace, across from the king&#x2019;s house, while the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, facing the entrance of the house. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>So it was, when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, <i>that</i> she found favor in his sight, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that <i>was</i> in his hand. Then Esther went near and touched the top of the scepter.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And the king said to her, &#x201C;What do you wish, Queen Esther? What <i>is</i> your request? It shall be given to you&#x2014;up to half the kingdom!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>So Esther answered, &#x201C;If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Then the king said, &#x201C;Bring Haman quickly, that he may do as Esther has said.&#x201D; So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>At the banquet of wine the king said to Esther, &#x201C;What <i>is</i> your petition? It shall be granted you. What <i>is</i> your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Then Esther answered and said, &#x201C;My petition and request <i>is this:</i> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, then let the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>So Haman went out that day joyful and with a glad heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king&#x2019;s gate, and that he did not stand or tremble before him, he was filled with indignation against Mordecai. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home, and he sent and called for his friends and his wife Zeresh. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Then Haman told them of his great riches, the multitude of his children, everything in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the officials and servants of the king.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Moreover Haman said, &#x201C;Besides, Queen Esther invited no one but me to come in with the king to the banquet that she prepared; and tomorrow I am again invited by her, along with the king. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king&#x2019;s gate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, &#x201C;Let a gallows be made, fifty cubits high, and in the morning suggest to the king that Mordecai be hanged on it; then go merrily with the king to the banquet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>And the thing pleased Haman; so he had the gallows made.</span></p><p><span><span>6&#xA0;</span>That night the king could not sleep. So one was commanded to bring the book of the records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And it was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king&#x2019;s eunuchs, the doorkeepers who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then the king said, &#x201C;What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>And the king&#x2019;s servants who attended him said, &#x201C;Nothing has been done for him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>So the king said, &#x201C;Who <i>is</i> in the court?&#x201D; Now Haman had <i>just</i> entered the outer court of the king&#x2019;s palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>The king&#x2019;s servants said to him, &#x201C;Haman is there, standing in the court.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>And the king said, &#x201C;Let him come in.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>So Haman came in, and the king asked him, &#x201C;What shall be done for the man whom the king delights to honor?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Now Haman thought in his heart, &#x201C;Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And Haman answered the king, &#x201C;<i>For</i> the man whom the king delights to honor, </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>let a royal robe be brought which the king has worn, and a horse on which the king has ridden, which has a royal crest placed on its head. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then let this robe and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king&#x2019;s most noble princes, that he may array the man whom the king delights to honor. Then parade him on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him: &#x2018;Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Then the king said to Haman, &#x201C;Hurry, take the robe and the horse, as you have suggested, and do so for Mordecai the Jew who sits within the king&#x2019;s gate! Leave nothing undone of all that you have spoken.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>So Haman took the robe and the horse, arrayed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the city square, and proclaimed before him, &#x201C;Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Afterward Mordecai went back to the king&#x2019;s gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>When Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him, his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, &#x201C;If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him but will surely fall before him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>While they <i>were</i> still talking with him, the king&#x2019;s eunuchs came, and hastened to bring Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.</span></p><p><span><span>7&#xA0;</span>So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And on the second day, at the banquet of wine, the king again said to Esther, &#x201C;What <i>is</i> your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what <i>is</i> your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then Queen Esther answered and said, &#x201C;If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>For we have been sold, my people and I, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. Had we been sold as male and female slaves, I would have held my tongue, although the enemy could never compensate for the king&#x2019;s loss.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>So King Ahasuerus answered and said to Queen Esther, &#x201C;Who is he, and where is he, who would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And Esther said, &#x201C;The adversary and enemy <i>is</i> this wicked Haman!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>So Haman was terrified before the king and queen.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Then the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine <i>and went</i> into the palace garden; but Haman stood before Queen Esther, pleading for his life, for he saw that evil was determined against him by the king. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>When the king returned from the palace garden to the place of the banquet of wine, Haman had fallen across the couch where Esther <i>was.</i> Then the king said, &#x201C;Will he also assault the queen while I <i>am</i> in the house?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>As the word left the king&#x2019;s mouth, they covered Haman&#x2019;s face. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Now Harbonah, one of the eunuchs, said to the king, &#x201C;Look! The gallows, fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke good on the king&#x2019;s behalf, is standing at the house of Haman.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then the king said, &#x201C;Hang him on it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king&#x2019;s wrath subsided.</span></p><p><span><span>8&#xA0;</span>On that day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told how he <i>was related</i> to her. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>So the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai; and Esther appointed Mordecai over the house of Haman.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Now Esther spoke again to the king, fell down at his feet, and implored him with tears to counteract the evil of Haman the Agagite, and the scheme which he had devised against the Jews. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king, </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>and said, &#x201C;If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight and the thing <i>seems</i> right to the king and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to annihilate the Jews who <i>are</i> in all the king&#x2019;s provinces. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>For how can I endure to see the evil that will come to my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my countrymen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, &#x201C;Indeed, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he <i>tried to</i> lay his hand on the Jews. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>You yourselves write <i>a decree</i> concerning the Jews, as you please, in the king&#x2019;s name, and seal <i>it</i> with the king&#x2019;s signet ring; for whatever is written in the king&#x2019;s name and sealed with the king&#x2019;s signet ring no one can revoke.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>So the king&#x2019;s scribes were called at that time, in the third month, which <i>is</i> the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third <i>day;</i> and it was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, the satraps, the governors, and the princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces <i>in all,</i> to every province in its own script, to every people in their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed <i>it</i> with the king&#x2019;s signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horseback, riding on royal horses bred from swift steeds.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>By these letters the king permitted the Jews who <i>were</i> in every city to gather together and protect their lives&#x2014;to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the forces of any people or province that would assault them, <i>both</i> little children and women, and to plunder their possessions, </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth <i>day</i> of the twelfth month, which <i>is</i> the month of Adar. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province and published for all people, so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>The couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king&#x2019;s command. And the decree was issued in Shushan the citadel.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>So Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, with a great crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple; and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>The Jews had light and gladness, joy and honor. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>And in every province and city, wherever the king&#x2019;s command and decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a holiday. Then many of the people of the land became Jews, because fear of the Jews fell upon them.</span></p><p><span><span>9&#xA0;</span>Now in the twelfth month, that <i>is,</i> the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day, <i>the time</i> came for the king&#x2019;s command and his decree to be executed. On the day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, the opposite occurred, in that the Jews themselves overpowered those who hated them. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>The Jews gathered together in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm. And no one could withstand them, because fear of them fell upon all people. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And all the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and all those doing the king&#x2019;s work, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>For Mordecai <i>was</i> great in the king&#x2019;s palace, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for this man Mordecai became increasingly prominent. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Thus the Jews defeated all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, with slaughter and destruction, and did what they pleased with those who hated them.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And in Shushan the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Also Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews&#x2014;they killed; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>On that day the number of those who were killed in Shushan the citadel was brought to the king. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And the king said to Queen Esther, &#x201C;The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the citadel, and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king&#x2019;s provinces? Now what <i>is</i> your petition? It shall be granted to you. Or what <i>is</i> your further request? It shall be done.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Then Esther said, &#x201C;If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who <i>are</i> in Shushan to do again tomorrow according to today&#x2019;s decree, and let Haman&#x2019;s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>So the king commanded this to be done; the decree was issued in Shushan, and they hanged Haman&#x2019;s ten sons.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And the Jews who <i>were</i> in Shushan gathered together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred men at Shushan; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>The remainder of the Jews in the king&#x2019;s provinces gathered together and protected their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of their enemies; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup><i>This was</i> on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. And on the fourteenth of <i>the month</i> they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But the Jews who <i>were</i> at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth <i>day,</i> as well as on the fourteenth; and on the fifteenth of <i>the month</i> they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the Jews of the villages who dwelt in the unwalled towns celebrated the fourteenth day of the month of Adar <i>with</i> gladness and feasting, as a holiday, and for sending presents to one another.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>And Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters to all the Jews, near and far, who <i>were</i> in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>to establish among them that they should celebrate yearly the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar, </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, as the month which was turned from sorrow to joy for them, and from mourning to a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and joy, of sending presents to one another and gifts to the poor. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>So the Jews accepted the custom which they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>because Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to annihilate them, and had cast Pur (that <i>is,</i> the lot), to consume them and destroy them; </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>but when <i>Esther</i> came before the king, he commanded by letter that this wicked plot which <i>Haman</i> had devised against the Jews should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>So they called these days Purim, after the name Pur. Therefore, because of all the words of this letter, what they had seen concerning this matter, and what had happened to them, </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>the Jews established and imposed it upon themselves and their descendants and all who would join them, that without fail they should celebrate these two days every year, according to the written <i>instructions</i> and according to the <i>prescribed</i> time, </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup><i>that</i> these days <i>should be</i> remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city, that these days of Purim should not fail <i>to be observed</i> among the Jews, and <i>that</i> the memory of them should not perish among their descendants.</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>And <i>Mordecai</i> sent letters to all the Jews, to the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, <i>with</i> words of peace and truth, </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>to confirm these days of Purim at their <i>appointed</i> time, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had prescribed for them, and as they had decreed for themselves and their descendants concerning matters of their fasting and lamenting. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>So the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim, and it was written in the book.</span></p>'
            'Exodus 19': '<h3> <span>Exodus 19</span></h3><p><span><span>19&#xA0;</span>In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came <i>to</i> the Wilderness of Sinai. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>For they had departed from Rephidim, had come <i>to</i> the Wilderness of Sinai, and camped in the wilderness. So Israel camped there before the mountain.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And Moses went up to God, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> called to him from the mountain, saying, &#x201C;Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>&#x2018;You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and <i>how</i> I bore you on eagles&#x2019; wings and brought you to Myself. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth <i>is</i> Mine. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#x2019; These <i>are</i> the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>So Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before them all these words which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> commanded him. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then all the people answered together and said, &#x201C;All that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> has spoken we will do.&#x201D; So Moses brought back the words of the people to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#x201C;Behold, I come to you in the thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you forever.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>So Moses told the words of the people to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#x201C;Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And let them be ready for the third day.

So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king&apos;s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king&apos;s gate.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.</span></p><p><span><span>6&#xA0;</span>On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king&apos;s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king&apos;s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king&apos;s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And the king&apos;s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king&apos;s most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king&apos;s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And Mordecai came again to the king&apos;s gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And while they were yet talking with him, came the king&apos;s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.</span></p><p><span><span>7&#xA0;</span>So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king&apos;s damage.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of king&apos;s mouth, they covered Haman&apos;s face.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king&apos;s wrath pacified.</span></p><p><span><span>8&#xA0;</span>On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews&apos; enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king&apos;s provinces:</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king&apos;s name, and seal it with the king&apos;s ring: for the writing which is written in the king&apos;s name, and sealed with the king&apos;s ring, may no man reverse.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then were the king&apos;s scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus&apos; name, and sealed it with the king&apos;s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king&apos;s commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king&apos;s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.</span></p><p><span><span>9&#xA0;</span>Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king&apos;s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>For Mordecai was great in the king&apos;s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king&apos;s provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day&apos;s decree, and let Haman&apos;s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman&apos;s ten sons.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>But the other Jews that were in the king&apos;s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;</span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.</span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.</span></p>'

### Be a Priest

<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:5–10">1 Pet. 2:5–10</a>

**CONCLUDE**

Following Jesus is a privileged position and a high calling. In responding to the invitation to follow Him, we step into a different reality and a new and rewarding way of living. Not that everything goes smoothly, but we become part of the household of God and have direct access to the Creator and Ruler of the universe. But this is not for only our benefit or holiness. We became representatives of God’s family, God’s kingdom, to those around us, as agents of the love, hope, and reconciliation He offers to all people.

**CONSIDER**

- Researching the household of the leader of your nation or some other significant household, such as the White House, Buckingham Palace, or something similar (see Sabbath’s lesson, for example). What is special about the house the leader lives in?
- Thinking back to the stories of Joseph (<a class="verse" verse="Gen 41:37–57">Gen. 41:37–57</a>), Daniel (<a class="verse" verse="Daniel 1–6">Daniel 1–6</a>), or Esther (<a class="verse" verse="Esther 4–9">Esther 4–9</a>). Imagine what it might mean for you to be involved in your nation’s government, like these Bible heroes, at the same time as you are seeking to stay true to God. Make a list of what achievements and difficulties you might face in such a role.
- Thinking of someone who has demonstrated the reality and love of God to you, perhaps a parent, a mentor, a teacher, a pastor, or a youth leader. Write the person either a letter of thanks, or talk with him or her about this person’s contribution to your life and faith.
- Making a list of the people you have influence with or over, including friends, younger relatives, or younger church people. Think about how you could be more intentional in representing God to them.
- Finding some safe space that is completely dark, and spending a few minutes sitting quietly in the darkness. Reflect on the experience and what it means to be light in the darkness. Then safely light a candle or turn on a small flashlight, and observe the difference. Ask God to help you be a light where you are.
