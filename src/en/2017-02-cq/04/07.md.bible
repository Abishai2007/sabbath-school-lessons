            '1 Corinthians 13': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 13</span></h3><p><span><span>13&#xA0;</span>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And though I have <i>the gift of</i> prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And though I bestow all my goods to feed <i>the poor,</i> and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Love suffers long <i>and</i> is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Love never fails. But whether <i>there are</i> prophecies, they will fail; whether <i>there are</i> tongues, they will cease; whether <i>there is</i> knowledge, it will vanish away. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>For we know in part and we prophesy in part. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these <i>is</i> love.</span></p>'

### Love God, Love People

<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 4:8">1 Pet. 4:8</a>

**CONCLUDE**

Our interactions with people help define who we are and how we grow. This is a two-way street; we are also responsible for our influence on those around us. As a Christian, my social relationships provide opportunities for me to show my allegiance to Jesus and my commitment to His values. Modeling my relationships after Christ should mean that I stand out in a positive way. Christianity is first and foremost about loving others as we have been loved: uncritically, unconditionally, despite our faults and even our antagonism.

**CONSIDER**

- Reading the short story “Where Love Is, God Is,” by Leo Tolstoy.
- Meditating on ways you can choose loving action this week.
- Logging and charting your interactions with people over a certain period of time (an afternoon, a day, or a week). Rate each instance on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being neutral, and 5 being extremely positive. Note any particular growth areas you see.
- Creating a piece of art that shows what Jesus means to you. Share your artwork with your friends.
- Choosing three Bible characters who treated people in a Christlike manner. Write a paragraph about each, including how you can incorporate those traits in your interactions.
- Researching several hymns that paraphrase <a class="verse" verse="1 Corinthians 13">1 Corinthians 13</a>, or writing your own hymn.
- Asking at least ten different people (include as many non-Christians as possible) what social values or characteristics they most associate with Christians. How do their answers relate to this week’s lesson?
- Making a mobile to illustrate Jesus’ words in <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 22:40">Matthew 22:40</a>: “ ‘On these . . . hang all the Law and the Prophets’ ” (NKJV).
