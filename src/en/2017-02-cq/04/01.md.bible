            '1 Pet 2:11–3:7': '<h3> <span>1 Peter 2:11-3:7</span></h3><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Beloved, I beg <i>you</i> as sojourners and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul, </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>having your conduct honorable among the Gentiles, that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by <i>your</i> good works which they observe, glorify God in the day of visitation.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord&#x2019;s sake, whether to the king as supreme, </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and <i>for the</i> praise of those who do good. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of God. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Honor all <i>people.</i> Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Servants, <i>be</i> submissive to <i>your</i> masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>For this <i>is</i> commendable, if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering wrongfully. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>For what credit <i>is it</i> if, when you are beaten for your faults, you take it patiently? But when you do good and suffer, if you take it patiently, this <i>is</i> commendable before God. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x201C;Who committed no sin,</span></span><br><span><span>Nor was deceit found in His mouth&#x201D;</span>; </span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed <i>Himself</i> to Him who judges righteously; </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness&#x2014;by whose stripes you were healed. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</span></p><p><span><span>3&#xA0;</span>Wives, likewise, <i>be</i> submissive to your own husbands, that even if some do not obey the word, they, without a word, may be won by the conduct of their wives, </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>when they observe your chaste conduct <i>accompanied</i> by fear. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Do not let your adornment be <i>merely</i> outward&#x2014;arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on <i>fine</i> apparel&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>rather <i>let it be</i> the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible <i>beauty</i> of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, being submissive to their own husbands, </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose daughters you are if you do good and are not afraid with any terror.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Husbands, likewise, dwell with <i>them</i> with understanding, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as <i>being</i> heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.</span></p>'

### Wild Child

<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:11–3:7">1 Pet. 2:11–3:7</a>


From Tarzan to Mowgli to George of the Jungle, many popular books and movies reflect society’s fascination with the concept of someone being raised by animals. Cases such as these are, unfortunately, not limited to the imaginings of Hollywood. A cursory search of feral children shows dozens of documented cases of children who were lost, taken, or abandoned and either were adopted by animals or had to survive in complete social isolation.

**It is absolutely paramount that we learn to be discerning about with whom we associate.**

In 1970, Los Angeles authorities were alerted to a potential case of abuse. They found a 13-year-old girl who had been kept bound in her room since she was a toddler. Genie (a pseudonym created to protect her identity) had had almost no human interaction and was severely malnourished. A series of transfers of care left her ultimately living out her days in a special care facility for mentally underdeveloped adults, never fully able to join society.

Unlike their big-screen counterparts, feral children don’t just magically learn English and table manners overnight. They struggle to learn the most elementary abilities, such as walking upright, eating cooked foods, and, most crippling, communicating. Language is inherent to our ability to reason, learn, and develop our characters.

For good or bad, our personal and spiritual growth is affected tremendously by our social interactions. Our parents are the first to begin influencing our characters. Their DNA determines our physical traits, mental health, and arguably even many of our talents and interests. Infancy and early childhood are some of the most formative years in determining who we will become as adults. How our parents and caregivers love, discipline, nurture, or neglect us have a lifetime of consequences.

As we grow, the rest of society begins to have a say in who we become.

Our national culture, our education, our government and media, our jobs, the friends we make—each one slowly sends us down a path toward self-identity.

That is why it is absolutely paramount that we learn to be discerning about with whom we associate and how we interact with them. Every exchange is molding both our characters and those of the people around us. Every workweek, every class lecture, and every text message is shaping who we become and who our peers become. To use that influence for Christ, for advancing the gospel and teaching others about His character, is our duty as Christians. As you read this week’s lesson, consider how your social interactions affect your faith and the faith of those around you.
