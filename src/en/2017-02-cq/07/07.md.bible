            'Hebrews 11–13': '<h3> <span>Hebrews 11-13</span></h3><p><span><span>11&#xA0;</span>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>For by it the elders obtained a <i>good</i> testimony.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>By faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death, <span>&#x201C;and was not found, because God had taken him&#x201D;</span>;  for before he was taken he had this testimony, that he pleased God. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>But without faith <i>it is</i> impossible to please <i>Him,</i> for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and <i>that</i> He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as <i>in</i> a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise; </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>for he waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker <i>is</i> God.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>By faith Sarah herself also received strength to conceive seed, and she bore a child when she was past the age, because she judged Him faithful who had promised. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born <i>as many</i> as the stars of the sky in multitude&#x2014;innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off were assured of them, embraced <i>them</i> and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And truly if they had called to mind that <i>country</i> from which they had come out, they would have had opportunity to return. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>But now they desire a better, that is, a heavenly <i>country.</i> Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten <i>son,</i> </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>of whom it was said, <span>&#x201C;In Isaac your seed shall be called,&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>concluding that God <i>was</i> able to raise <i>him</i> up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, <i>leaning</i> on the top of his staff.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel, and gave instructions concerning his bones.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw <i>he was</i> a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king&#x2019;s command.</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>By faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter, </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the reward.</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he who destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry <i>land, whereas</i> the Egyptians, attempting to do so, were drowned.</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were encircled for seven days. </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who did not believe, when she had received the spies with peace.</span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barak and Samson and Jephthah, also <i>of</i> David and Samuel and the prophets: </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in battle, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>Women received their dead raised to life again.</span></p><p><span>Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. </span> <span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>Still others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yes, and of chains and imprisonment. </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>They were stoned, they were sawn in two, were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, <i>in</i> dens and caves of the earth.</span></p><p><span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>And all these, having obtained a good testimony through faith, did not receive the promise, </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>God having provided something better for us, that they should not be made perfect apart from us.</span></p><p><span><span>12&#xA0;</span>Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares <i>us,</i> and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of <i>our</i> faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>You have not yet resisted to bloodshed, striving against sin. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x201C;My son, do not despise the chastening of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>,</span></span><br><span><span>Nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him;</span></span><br><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup><span>For whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> loves He chastens,</span></span><br><span><span>And scourges every son whom He receives.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom a father does not chasten? </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Furthermore, we have had human fathers who corrected <i>us,</i> and we paid <i>them</i> respect. Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live? </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For they indeed for a few days chastened <i>us</i> as seemed <i>best</i> to them, but He for <i>our</i> profit, that <i>we</i> may be partakers of His holiness. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Now no chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore strengthen the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Pursue peace with all <i>people,</i> and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord: </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>looking carefully lest anyone fall short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up cause trouble, and by this many become defiled; </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>lest there <i>be</i> any fornicator or profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For you have not come to the mountain that may be touched and that burned with fire, and to blackness and darkness and tempest, </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, so that those who heard <i>it</i> begged that the word should not be spoken to them anymore. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>(For they could not endure what was commanded: <span>&#x201C;And if so much as a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned</span> <span>or shot with an arrow.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And so terrifying was the sight <i>that</i> Moses said, <span>&#x201C;I am exceedingly afraid</span> and trembling.&#x201D;)</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>to the general assembly and church of the firstborn <i>who are</i> registered in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect, </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than <i>that of</i> Abel.</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape who refused Him who spoke on earth, much more <i>shall we not escape</i> if we turn away from Him who <i>speaks</i> from heaven, </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, <span>&#x201C;Yet once more I shake</span> <span>not only the earth, but also heaven.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Now this, <span>&#x201C;Yet once more,&#x201D;</span> indicates the removal of those things that are being shaken, as of things that are made, that the things which cannot be shaken may remain.</span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>For our God <i>is</i> a consuming fire.</span></p><p><span><span>13&#xA0;</span>Let brotherly love continue. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so <i>doing</i> some have unwittingly entertained angels. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Remember the prisoners as if chained with them&#x2014;those who are mistreated&#x2014;since you yourselves are in the body also.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Marriage <i>is</i> honorable among all, and the bed undefiled; but fornicators and adulterers God will judge.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup><i>Let your</i> conduct <i>be</i> without covetousness; <i>be</i> content with such things as you have. For He Himself has said, <span>&#x201C;I will never leave you nor forsake you.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>So we may boldly say:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x201C;The L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span> <i>is</i> my helper;</span></span><br><span><span>I will not fear.</span></span><br><span><span>What can man do to me?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Remember those who rule over you, who have spoken the word of God to you, whose faith follow, considering the outcome of <i>their</i> conduct. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Jesus Christ <i>is</i> the same yesterday, today, and forever. </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Do not be carried about with various and strange doctrines. For <i>it is</i> good that the heart be established by grace, not with foods which have not profited those who have been occupied with them.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered outside the gate. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Therefore let us go forth to Him, outside the camp, bearing His reproach. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For here we have no continuing city, but we seek the one to come. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Therefore by Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of <i>our</i> lips, giving thanks to His name. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>But do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Obey those who rule over you, and be submissive, for they watch out for your souls, as those who must give account. Let them do so with joy and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable for you.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Pray for us; for we are confident that we have a good conscience, in all things desiring to live honorably. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>But I especially urge <i>you</i> to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Now may the God of peace who brought up our Lord Jesus from the dead, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>make you complete in every good work to do His will, working in you what is well pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom <i>be</i> glory forever and ever. Amen.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>And I appeal to you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Know that <i>our</i> brother Timothy has been set free, with whom I shall see you if he comes shortly.</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Greet all those who rule over you, and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Grace <i>be</i> with you all. Amen.</span></p>'

            'Hebrews 11–13': '<h3> <span>Hebrews 11-13</span></h3><p><span><span>11&#xA0;</span>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>For by it the elders obtained a good report.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king&apos;s commandment.</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh&apos;s daughter;</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.</span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae;

that they might obtain a better resurrection:</span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:</span></p><p><span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;</span></p><p><span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</span></p><p><span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:</span></p><p><span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.</span></p><p><span><span>12&#xA0;</span>Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.</span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>For our God is a consuming fire.</span></p><p><span><span>13&#xA0;</span>Let brotherly love continue.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines.

### The Privilege of Living for Christ

<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 3:14; 4:15, 16">1 Pet. 3:14; 4:15, 16</a>

**CONCLUDE**
Members of the early church faced a huge dilemma: follow Jesus or conform to the demands of the Roman government. For those who believed in Jesus, however, this wasn’t even a choice. Not to believe or not to follow in Jesus’ steps would have been much worse than facing persecution from the Romans. How many of us have faced true persecution in our own lives? It can become easy to coast through our Christian walk, lacking the passion and perseverance of the early church. However, we should never take for granted what a privilege it is to live for—and suffer for—Jesus!

**CONSIDER**
- Journaling about the ways in which the Lord is blessing you right now. Reflect upon these journal notes when you find yourself in a darker time—specifically facing persecution—and be encouraged by the Lord’s provision in the past.
- Praying for specific missionaries working in a country that is closed to the gospel of Jesus (not just missionaries at large). If possible, open the lines of communication with these missionaries though e-mails or letters, sharing encouraging Bible verses and letting them know that you are praying for them, or even send them care packages.
- Composing a piece of music, with or without lyrics, that portrays the strength and hope of the early Christians, even in the face of persecution. Perform this piece for your Sabbath School class or small group.
- Considering mission work for yourself. While this may seem daunting, it is important to remember the sacrifice that Christ made when He came to this planet and died for us. How could any of our earthly trials compare to that?
- Meditating on the trials of the early church—especially those discussed in this week’s Logos verses. As you do, ask the Lord to reveal specific lessons from their lives that could impact your own life.
- Painting or drawing a picture that depicts the persecution of the early church. If possible, incorporate some kind of symbol that indicates the hope of Jesus that sustained the Christians. Share this picture with your Sabbath School class or small group.
